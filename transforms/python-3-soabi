# Python 3 uses ABI versioned tags for .so files:
# ".cpython-3#[d].so", where # is the minor version, and "d" is added if built
# --with-pydebug (not used on Solaris). Previously, there were additional flags
# for --with-wide-unicode ('u') and --with-pymalloc ('m'); those are no longer
# being used.
# See http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3149/ for more information.

# A newer version of python setup tools enables to create ABI3 compliant
# extensions that should support all python3.X versions where X >= 2.
# The compiled shared libraries have ".abi3.so" suffix to indicate the
# usage of the limited API. Currently, only the components that depend on
# library/python/cffi are forced to generate ABI3 compliant extensions.
