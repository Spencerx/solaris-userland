Unzip 610c25 seems to have older/different version without known history. But given the patch
26-cve-2019-13232-fix-bug-in-uzinflate.patch it seems the change can be adopted too.

Subject: Fix bug in UZbunzip2() that incorrectly updated G.incnt
Origin: https://github.com/madler/unzip/commit/5e2efcd633a4a1fb95a129a75508e7d769e767be
Bug-Debian: https://bugs.debian.org/963996
X-Debian-version: 6.0-26

    Fix bug in UZbunzip2() that incorrectly updated G.incnt.
    
    The update assumed a full buffer, which is not always full. This
    could result in a false overlapped element detection when a small
    bzip2-compressed file was unzipped. This commit remedies that.
