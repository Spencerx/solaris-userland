1. Create two files that are slightly different.
2. Compare them using diff -u.
3. Now apply diffstat to the diff -u like below and see if it works:
$ diff -u file update | diffstat

4. Export the differences into a file.
$ diff -u file update > test.diff

5. Check using the format flag 
(
    0 for concise output that shows only values with histogram signs +, -, and !
    1 is the default output format of the diffstat command
    2 fills out the histogram with dots
    4 prints value with histogram
):
$ diffstat -f 0 test.diff

6. Use -C for colors, -t for tabular, -l for listing, -m to merge the inserts and deletes, or -o to output in file:
$ diffstat -C test.diff 
$ diffstat -t test.diff
$ diffstat -l test.diff
$ diffstat -m test.diff
$ diffstat -m test.diff -o output.stat
