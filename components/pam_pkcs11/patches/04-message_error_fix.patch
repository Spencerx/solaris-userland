#
# This patch is to fix one spelling error and some message problems in PAM
# prompt, so that they will comply to the Solaris message style.
# 
# The authentication spelling error has been already fixed in the latest
# upstream source, so there is no need to contribute back this spelling error
# fix. We will remove the spelling error change from this patch, when we 
# upgrade this module to a new release that contains the spelling error fix.
#
# Changes from smartcard to "smart card" in pam_prompt messages are for
# Solaris message style compliance and they are Solaris specific.
