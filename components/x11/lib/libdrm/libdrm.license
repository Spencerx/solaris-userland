DESCRIPTION

This file contains a straightforward implementation of a fixed-sized
hash table using self-organizing linked lists [Knuth73, pp. 398-399] for
collision resolution.  There are two potentially interesting things
about this implementation:

1) The table is power-of-two sized.  Prime sized tables are more
traditional, but do not have a significant advantage over power-of-two
sized table, especially when double hashing is not used for collision
resolution.

2) The hash computation uses a table of random integers [Hanson97,
pp. 39-41].

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

With a table size of 512, the current implementation is sufficient for a
few hundred keys.  Since this is well above the expected size of the
tables for which this implementation was designed, the implementation of
dynamic hash tables was postponed until the need arises.  A common (and
naive) approach to dynamic hash table implementation simply creates a
new hash table when necessary, rehashes all the data into the new table,
and destroys the old table.  The approach in [Larson88] is superior in
two ways: 1) only a portion of the table is expanded when needed,
distributing the expansion cost over several insertions, and 2) portions
of the table can be locked, enabling a scalable thread-safe
implementation.
