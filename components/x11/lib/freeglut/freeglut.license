## Files:
src/fg_font_data.c

This file has been automatically generated by the
genfonts utility.

The legal status of this file is a bit vague.  The font glyphs
themselves come from XFree86 v4.3.0 (as of this writing), and as
part of the X server may be subject to the XFree86 copyrights.
The original freeglut fonts were extracted by a utility written
by Pawel W. Olszta (see below) and the generated fonts contained
his copyright exclusively.  Steve Baker asserts that Pawel
assigned intellectual property rights to Steve Baker.  Steve
Baker also asserts that fonts cannot be copyrighted.  He has
neither stripped the copyright from the freeglut fonts nor
formally retitled anything in his name.  Since that time, the
OpenGLUT project has branched from freeglut, and has made
necessary modifications to Pawel's ``genfonts'' utility.
To that extent, OpenGLUT may have some title to this file.
What is fairly clear is that the font data is licensed under
the XFree86 license (which is variously termed ``XFree'' and
``MIT'' by the freeglut project).  It is believed that all
title holders wish this file to be as useful as possible, and
that either the ``XFree'' or ``MIT'' license works.

Copyright (c) 1999-2000 by Pawel W. Olszta
Portions copyright (c) 2004, the OpenGLUT project contributors.
OpenGLUT branched from freeglut in February, 2004.
