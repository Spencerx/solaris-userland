We do not have hatchling on Solaris, and it doesn't seem necessary
to deliver it at this point. This patch modifies the build metadata
to use setuptools instead.

Also, the GitHub archive we use doesn't contain all the info necessary
to guess the package version automatically, which is why it's explicitly
listed here.

Not intended for upstream.
