Fixes 01-CVE-2025-47273.

Desc:
  A path traversal vulnerability in `PackageIndex` is present in setuptools
  prior to version 78.1.1. An attacker would be allowed to write files to
  arbitrary locations on the filesystem with the permissions of the process
  running the Python code, which could escalate to remote code execution
  depending on the context.
