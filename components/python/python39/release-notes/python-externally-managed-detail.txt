Starting with Oracle Solaris SRU 69, the Python system environment is marked
as externally managed. This means that tools like `pip' will no longer allow
you to modify or install additional Python packages into directories where
other system applications can see and import them.

The change intends to prevent `pip' from modifying the environment managed
by `pkg' (which can otherwise result in breakages of Python system utilities
or other Python packages delivered with Oracle Solaris), and follows other
operating systems and Linux distributions.

Note that this change also affects installation into users' home directory
using the `--user' flag, as packages installed in such a way are still
visible to systems scripts and thus can result in unexpected behavior.


In order to keep the installation of Python applications as simple as possible,
you can install the pipx tool [1]. Python applications installed with pipx
are fully isolated in their own virtual environment and hence cannot affect
the system.

Should you want to use some python libraries provided via `pkg', you can run
`pipx' with the `--system-site-packages' flag, but keep in mind that we cannot
guarantee that future updates of one such system package won't introduce some
incompatible changes that will break your `pipx' installed application.

You can find more about pipx usage in its documentation [1]:
https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/

Note that `pipx' is intended for applications only; that is, Python packages
that have executable entry points. If you want to install Python libraries
for use with your application, you can still use the standard venv module [2]
or virtualenv tool [3] as provided with Oracle Solaris.
