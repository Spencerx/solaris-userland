memcached-1.6.18/md5.c

  Independent implementation of MD5 (RFC 1321).

  This code implements the MD5 Algorithm defined in RFC 1321, whose
  text is available at
	http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1321.txt
  The code is derived from the text of the RFC, including the test suite
  (section A.5) but excluding the rest of Appendix A.  It does not include
  any code or documentation that is identified in the RFC as being
  copyrighted.

  The original and principal author of md5.c is L. Peter Deutsch
  <ghost@aladdin.com>.  Other authors are noted in the change history
  that follows (in reverse chronological order):

  2002-04-13 lpd Clarified derivation from RFC 1321; now handles byte order
	either statically or dynamically; added missing #include <string.h>
	in library.
  2002-03-11 lpd Corrected argument list for main(), and added int return
	type, in test program and T value program.
  2002-02-21 lpd Added missing #include <stdio.h> in test program.
  2000-07-03 lpd Patched to eliminate warnings about "constant is
	unsigned in ANSI C, signed in traditional"; made test program
	self-checking.
  1999-11-04 lpd Edited comments slightly for automatic TOC extraction.
  1999-10-18 lpd Fixed typo in header comment (ansi2knr rather than md5).
  1999-05-03 lpd Original version.

=== itoa_ljust.h - Fast integer to ascii conversion

 Fast and simple integer to ASCII conversion:

   - 32 and 64-bit integers
   - signed and unsigned
   - user supplied buffer must be large enough for all decimal digits
     in value plus minus sign if negative
   - left-justified
   - NUL terminated
   - return value is pointer to NUL terminator

=== itoa_ljust.cpp - Fast integer to ascii conversion           --*- C++ -*-//

 Substantially simplified (and slightly faster) version
 based on the following functions in Google's protocol buffers:

    FastInt32ToBufferLeft()
    FastUInt32ToBufferLeft()
    FastInt64ToBufferLeft()
    FastUInt64ToBufferLeft()

 Differences:
    1) Greatly simplified
    2) Avoids GOTO statements - uses "switch" instead and relies on
       compiler constant folding and propagation for high performance
    3) Avoids unary minus of signed types - undefined behavior if value
       is INT_MIN in platforms using two's complement representation
    4) Uses memcpy to store 2 digits at a time - lets the compiler
       generate a 2-byte load/store in platforms that support
       unaligned access, this is faster (and less code) than explicitly
       loading and storing each byte

memcached-1.6.18/md5.h

  Independent implementation of MD5 (RFC 1321).

  This code implements the MD5 Algorithm defined in RFC 1321, whose
  text is available at
	http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1321.txt
  The code is derived from the text of the RFC, including the test suite
  (section A.5) but excluding the rest of Appendix A.  It does not include
  any code or documentation that is identified in the RFC as being
  copyrighted.

  The original and principal author of md5.h is L. Peter Deutsch
  <ghost@aladdin.com>.  Other authors are noted in the change history
  that follows (in reverse chronological order):

  2002-04-13 lpd Removed support for non-ANSI compilers; removed
	references to Ghostscript; clarified derivation from RFC 1321;
	now handles byte order either statically or dynamically.
  1999-11-04 lpd Edited comments slightly for automatic TOC extraction.
  1999-10-18 lpd Fixed typo in header comment (ansi2knr rather than md5);
	added conditionalization for C++ compilation from Martin
	Purschke <purschke@bnl.gov>.
  1999-05-03 lpd Original version.
