1.Create a a random text file with multiple rows and columns:
ps -ef > file.txt
2. Run some basic awk commands in order to see it work:
 a. awk '{print}' file.txt              -> for print the full file
 b. awk '/<key-word>/ {print}' file.txt -> to search for a certain pattern inside the file
 c. awk '{print $1, $2}' file.txt       -> to display only the first 2 columns
 d. awk '{if (length($0)>max) max=length($0)} END {print max}' file.txt -> find the longest row in the file
