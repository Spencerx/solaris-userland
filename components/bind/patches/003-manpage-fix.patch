 There are two common ways to generate the base\-64 string for the secret.
 The BIND 9 program \X'tty: link #std-iscman-rndc-confgen'\fI\%rndc\-confgen\fP\X'tty: link' can be used to generate a random
-key, or the \fBmmencode\fP program, also known as \fBmimencode\fP, can be
-used to generate a base\-64 string from known input. \fBmmencode\fP does
+key, or the \fBbase64\fP program, can be
+used to generate a base\-64 string from known input. \fBbase64\fP does
 not ship with BIND 9 but is available on many systems. See the Example
 section for sample command lines for each.
