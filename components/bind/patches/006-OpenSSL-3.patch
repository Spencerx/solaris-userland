Patch modifies Makefile.in and Makefile.am so that OpenSSL 3.0 library
path comes before libuv's path, which is in the default location
where OpenSSL 1.0.2 can also be found!

Patch provided upstream for their information:
https://gitlab.isc.org/isc-projects/bind9/-/issues/3414

I expect we shall need to maintain until OpenSSL 3.0 is the default.
