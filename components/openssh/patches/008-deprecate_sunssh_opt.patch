# To make the transition from SunSSH to OpenSSH as smooth as possible, we
# added SunSSH-only options as deprecated options in OpenSSH. Note that this
# is an interim enhancement to OpenSSH to make the transition smoother. If a 
# deprecated SunSSH-only option is migrated to OpenSSH later, then it will be
# changed from deprecated to supported. Since this is for Solaris only, we will
# not contribute back this change to the upstream community.
