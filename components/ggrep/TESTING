echo "grep is a command-line utility for searching plaintext datasets for lines that match a regular expression. Its name comes from the ed command g/re/p, which has the same effect. grep was originally developed for the Unix operating system, but later available for all Unix-like systems and some others such as OS-9." > test_file
	Testing:
1. Insensitive searches:
ggrep -i "UNIX" test_file
2. Counting search:
ggrep -c "in" test_file
3. Show only the file name that has the desired pattern:
echo "solaris" > second_test_file
ggrep -l "solaris" *
4. Line numbers where the pattern is found:
ggrep -n "systems" test_file
5. Multiple patterns search:
ggrep -ei "unix|solaris" *
6. Recursive search:
mkdir new_directory; mv second_test_file new_directory
ggrep -Rli "is" *
