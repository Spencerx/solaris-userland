The OpenSSL 1.0.2 FIPS 140-2 module will be removed from a future
release of Oracle Solaris.

Oracle Solaris OpenSSL consumers have been migrated to OpenSSL 3.
To enable FIPS 140 mode for OpenSSL 3 the 'openssl' pkg mediator is not used.
Instead ensure that 'pkg:/library/security/openssl-3/fips-140-provider'
is installed if a FIPS 140 configuration is required.
