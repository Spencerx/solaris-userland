When tcpflood is being linked, GNUTLS_LIBS (am__append_125) preceeds
OPENSSL_LIBS (am__append_128) and thus '-L/usr/lib/amd64' appears before
'-L/usr/openssl/3/lib/amd64'. This results in OpenSSL bits being linked
against OpenSSL 1.0.2 we have in the standard path.

This patch flips those two *_LIBS variables such that OpenSSL 3 library
dir is checked first.

This is Solaris specific and not intended for upstream.
