1. On the vm where stunnel is updated go to the following path:
$ cd /etc/stunnel

2. Create a pem file containing the certificate and private key.
 2.a. Generate a Private Key using openSSL:
$ openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private.key -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048
 2.b. Generate a Certificate Signing Request (there will start a prompt to enter information - no need to use accurate information for testing):
$ openssl req -new -key private.key -out certificate.csr
 2.c. Generate a self signed certificate (signing the certificate with your own private key):
$ openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in certificate.csr -signkey private.key -out certificate.crt
 2.d. Combine the private key file and certificate into a PEM File:
$ cat private.key certificate.crt > stunnel.pem
 2.e. Add this line to the /etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf file:
    cert = /etc/stunnel/stunnel.pem

3. Create a configuration file /etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf and add:
[https]
accept = 127.0.0.1:4443
connect = 127.0.0.1:443

4. Start stunnel with the following command:
$ sudo stunnel /etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf

5.Verify with tcpdump:
$ python3 -m http.server 443 &

6. Verify  with a Web Browser:
$ curl -k https://127.0.0.1:4443
