+# From Paul Eggert (2018-01-18):
+# The next line should look like this:
+#                       1:00   Eire    IST/GMT
+# However, in January 2018 we discovered that the Eire rules cause
+# problems with tests for ICU:
+# https://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2018-January/025825.html
+# and with tests for OpenJDK:
+# https://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2018-January/025822.html
+# To work around this problem, use a traditional approximation for
+# time stamps after 1971-10-31 02:00 UTC, to give ICU and OpenJDK
+# developers breathing room to fix bugs.  This approximation has
+# correct UTC offsets, but results in tm_isdst flags are the reverse
+# of what they should be.  This workaround is temporary and should be
+# removed reasonably soon.
