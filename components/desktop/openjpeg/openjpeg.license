$Log: uce-dirent.h,v $
Revision 1.7  2002/05/13 10:48:35  tr
embedded some source code directly to the header so that no source
modules need to be included in the MS Visual C project using the
interface, removed all the dependencies to other headers of the `uce'
library so that the header can be made public

Revision 1.6  2002/04/12 16:22:04  tr
Unified Compiling Environment (UCE) replaced `std' library

Revision 1.5  2001/07/20 16:33:40  tr
moved to `std' library and re-named defines accordingly

Revision 1.4  2001/07/10 16:47:18  tronkko
revised comments

Revision 1.3  2001/01/11 13:16:43  tr
using ``uce-machine.h'' for finding out defines such as `FREEBSD'

Revision 1.2  2000/10/08 16:00:41  tr
copy of FreeBSD man page

Revision 1.1  2000/07/10 05:53:16  tr
Initial revision

Revision 1.2  1998/07/19 18:29:14  tr
Added error reporting capabilities and some asserts.

Revision 1.1  1998/07/04 16:27:51  tr
Initial revision


MSVC 1.0 scans automatic dependencies incorrectly when your project
contains this very header.  The problem is that MSVC cannot handle
include directives inside #if..#endif block those are never entered.
Since this header ought to compile in many different operating systems,
there had to be several conditional blocks that are compiled only in
operating systems for what they were designed for.  MSVC 1.0 cannot
handle inclusion of sys/dir.h in a part that is compiled only in Apollo
operating system.  To fix the problem you need to insert DIR.H into
SYSINCL.DAT located in MSVC\BIN directory and restart visual C++.
Consult manuals for more information about the problem.

Since many UNIX systems have dirent.h we assume to have one also.
However, if your UNIX system does not have dirent.h you can download one
for example at: http://ftp.uni-mannheim.de/ftp/GNU/dirent/dirent.tar.gz.
You can also see if you have one of dirent.h, direct.h, dir.h, ndir.h,
sys/dir.h and sys/ndir.h somewhere.  Try defining HAVE_DIRENT_H,
HAVE_DIRECT_H, HAVE_DIR_H, HAVE_NDIR_H, HAVE_SYS_DIR_H and
HAVE_SYS_NDIR_H according to the files found.

 It is provided for plug-in writters that may want to access the support
 functions to do low level operations. All plug-in related structures
 are defined here. Including this file forces to include the standard API too.

TRADEMARK
=========

The name "libpng" has not been registered by the Copyright owners
as a trademark in any jurisdiction.  However, because libpng has
been distributed and maintained world-wide, continually since 1995,
the Copyright owners claim "common-law trademark protection" in any
jurisdiction where common-law trademark is recognized.


## Files:
thirdparty/libpng/png.h

A "png_get_copyright" function is available, for convenient use in "about"
boxes and the like:

   printf("%s", png_get_copyright(NULL));

Also, the PNG logo (in PNG format, of course) is supplied in the
files "pngbar.png" and "pngbar.jpg (88x31) and "pngnow.png" (98x31).


## Files:
thirdparty/libpng/png.h

With all write APIs if image is in one of the linear formats with 16-bit
data then setting convert_to_8_bit will cause the output to be an 8-bit PNG
gamma encoded according to the sRGB specification, otherwise a 16-bit linear
encoded PNG file is written.

With color-mapped data formats the colormap parameter point to a color-map
with at least image->colormap_entries encoded in the specified format.  If
the format is linear the written PNG color-map will be converted to sRGB
regardless of the convert_to_8_bit flag.

With all APIs row_stride is handled as in the read APIs - it is the spacing
from one row to the next in component sized units (1 or 2 bytes) and if
negative indicates a bottom-up row layout in the buffer.  If row_stride is
zero, libpng will calculate it for you from the image width and number of
channels.

Note that the write API does not support interlacing, sub-8-bit pixels or
most ancillary chunks.  If you need to write text chunks (e.g. for copyright
notices) you need to use one of the other APIs.

This file provides a location for all input.  Users who need
special handling are expected to write a function that has the same
arguments as this and performs a similar function, but that possibly
has a different input method.  Note that you shouldn't change this
function, but rather write a replacement function and then make
libpng use it at run time with png_set_read_fn(...).

WARNING: The type of JPEG encapsulation defined by the TIFF Version 6.0
specification is now totally obsolete and deprecated for new applications and
images. This file was was created solely in order to read unconverted images
still present on some users' computer systems. It will never be extended
to write such files. Writing new-style JPEG compressed TIFFs is implemented
in tif_jpeg.c.

The code is carefully crafted to robustly read all gathered JPEG-in-TIFF
testfiles, and anticipate as much as possible all other... But still, it may
fail on some. If you encounter problems, please report them on the TIFF
mailing list and/or to Joris Van Damme <info@awaresystems.be>.

Please read the file called "TIFF Technical Note #2" if you need to be
convinced this compression scheme is bad and breaks TIFF. That document
is linked to from the LibTiff site <http://www.remotesensing.org/libtiff/>
and from AWare Systems' TIFF section
<http://www.awaresystems.be/imaging/tiff.html>. It is also absorbed
in Adobe's specification supplements, marked "draft" up to this day, but
supported by the TIFF community.

This file interfaces with Release 6B of the JPEG Library written by the
Independent JPEG Group. Previous versions of this file required a hack inside
the LibJpeg library. This version no longer requires that. Remember to
remove the hack if you update from the old version.
