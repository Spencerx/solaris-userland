 tif_overview.c,v 1.9 2005/05/25 09:03:16 dron Exp

 Project:  TIFF Overview Builder
 Purpose:  Library function for building overviews in a TIFF file.
 Author:   Frank Warmerdam, warmerdam@pobox.com

 Notes:
  o Currently only images with bits_per_sample of a multiple of eight
    will work.

  o The downsampler currently just takes the top left pixel from the
    source rectangle.  Eventually sampling options of averaging, mode, and
    ``center pixel'' should be offered.

  o The code will attempt to use the same kind of compression,
    photometric interpretation, and organization as the source image, but
    it doesn't copy geotiff tags to the reduced resolution images.

  o Reduced resolution overviews for multi-sample files will currently
    always be generated as PLANARCONFIG_SEPARATE.  This could be fixed
    reasonable easily if needed to improve compatibility with other
    packages.  Many don't properly support PLANARCONFIG_SEPARATE.

  Revised:  2/18/01 BAR -- added syntax for extracting single images from
                          multi-image TIFF files.

    New syntax is:  sourceFileName,image#

 image# ranges from 0..<n-1> where n is the # of images in the file.
 There may be no white space between the comma and the filename or
 image number.

    Example:   tiffcp source.tif,1 destination.tif

 Copies the 2nd image in source.tif to the destination.

 Revision History:
 11-Jan-89: Created.
 06-Mar-90: fix bug in SCALE() macro.
	      got rid of xres and yres, (they weren't working anyways).
	      fixed bpsl calculation.

 Description:
   This program takes a Sun Rasterfile [see rasterfile(5)] as input and
 writes a MicroSoft/Aldus "Tagged Image File Format" image or "TIFF" file.
 The input file may be standard input, but the output TIFF file must be a
 real file since seek(2) is used.

TIFF Software Distribution
--------------------------
This file is just a placeholder; all the documentation is now in
HTML in the html directory.  To view the documentation point your
favorite WWW viewer at html/index.html; 

e.g.

    firefox html/index.html

If you don't have an HTML viewer then you can read the HTML source
or fetch a PostScript version of this documentation from the directory

    http://download.osgeo.org/libtiff/

If you can't hack either of these options then basically what you
want to do is:

    % ./configure
    % make
    % su
    # make install

tools/tiff2pdf.c

  This is the main function.

  The program converts one TIFF file to one PDF file, including multiple page
  TIFF files, tiled TIFF files, black and white. grayscale, and color TIFF
  files that contain data of TIFF photometric interpretations of bilevel,
  grayscale, RGB, YCbCr, CMYK separation, and ICC L*a*b* as supported by
  libtiff and PDF.

  If you have multiple TIFF files to convert into one PDF file then use tiffcp
  or other program to concatenate the files into a multiple page TIFF file.
  If the input TIFF file is of huge dimensions (greater than 10000 pixels height
  or width) convert the input image to a tiled TIFF if it is not already.

  The standard output is standard output.  Set the output file name with the
  "-o output.pdf" option.

  All black and white files are compressed into a single strip CCITT G4 Fax
  compressed PDF, unless tiled, where tiled black and white images are
  compressed into tiled CCITT G4 Fax compressed PDF, libtiff CCITT support
  is assumed.

  Color and grayscale data can be compressed using either JPEG compression,
  ITU-T T.81, or Zip/Deflate LZ77 compression, per PNG 1.2 and RFC 1951.  Set
  the compression type using the -j or -z options.  JPEG compression support
  requires that libtiff be configured with JPEG support, and Zip/Deflate
  compression support requires that libtiff is configured with Zip support,
  in tiffconf.h.  Use only one or the other of -j and -z.  The -q option
  sets the image compression quality, that is 1-100 with libjpeg JPEG
  compression and one of 1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15 for PNG group compression
  predictor methods, add 100, 200, ..., 900 to set zlib compression quality 1-9.
  PNG Group differencing predictor methods are not currently implemented.

  If the input TIFF contains single strip CCITT G4 Fax compressed information,
  then that is written to the PDF file without transcoding, unless the options
  of no compression and no passthrough are set, -d and -n.

  If the input TIFF contains JPEG or single strip Zip/Deflate compressed
  information, and they are configured, then that is written to the PDF file
  without transcoding, unless the options of no compression and no passthrough
  are set.

  The default page size upon which the TIFF image is placed is determined by
  the resolution and extent of the image data.  Default values for the TIFF
  image resolution can be set using the -x and -y options.  The page size can
  be set using the -p option for paper size, or -w and -l for paper width and
  length, then each page of the TIFF image is centered on its page.  The
  distance unit for default resolution and page width and length can be set
  by the -u option, the default unit is inch.

  Various items of the output document information can be set with the -e, -c,
  -a, -t, -s, and -k tags.  Setting the argument of the option to "" for these
  tags causes the relevant document information field to be not written.  Some
  of the document information values otherwise get their information from the
  input TIFF image, the software, author, document name, and image description.

  The output PDF file conforms to the PDF 1.1 specification or PDF 1.2 if using
  Zip/Deflate compression.

  Systems, Incorporated.  Todos derechos reservados.

libtiff/tif_ojpeg.c

WARNING: The type of JPEG encapsulation defined by the TIFF Version 6.0
specification is now totally obsolete and deprecated for new applications and
images. This file was was created solely in order to read unconverted images
still present on some users' computer systems. It will never be extended
to write such files. Writing new-style JPEG compressed TIFFs is implemented
in tif_jpeg.c.

The code is carefully crafted to robustly read all gathered JPEG-in-TIFF
testfiles, and anticipate as much as possible all other... But still, it may
fail on some. If you encounter problems, please report them on the TIFF
mailing list and/or to Joris Van Damme <info@awaresystems.be>.

Please read the file called "TIFF Technical Note #2" if you need to be
convinced this compression scheme is bad and breaks TIFF. That document
is linked to from the LibTiff site <http://www.remotesensing.org/libtiff/>
and from AWare Systems' TIFF section
<http://www.awaresystems.be/imaging/tiff.html>. It is also absorbed
in Adobe's specification supplements, marked "draft" up to this day, but
supported by the TIFF community.

This file interfaces with Release 6B of the JPEG Library written by the
Independent JPEG Group. Previous versions of this file required a hack inside
the LibJpeg library. This version no longer requires that. Remember to
remove the hack if you update from the old version.

Revision 1.0  90/05/07
     Initial release.
Revision 2.0  90/12/20
     Converted to use the Athena Widgets and the Xt Intrinsics.

Notes:

According to the TIFF 5.0 Specification, it is possible to have
both a TIFFTAG_COLORMAP and a TIFFTAG_COLORRESPONSECURVE.  This
doesn't make sense since a TIFFTAG_COLORMAP is 16 bits wide and
a TIFFTAG_COLORRESPONSECURVE is tfBitsPerSample bits wide for each
channel.  This is probably a bug in the specification.
In this case, TIFFTAG_COLORRESPONSECURVE is ignored.
This might make sense if TIFFTAG_COLORMAP was 8 bits wide.

TIFFTAG_COLORMAP is often incorrectly written as ranging from
0 to 255 rather than from 0 to 65535.  CheckAndCorrectColormap()
takes care of this.

Only ORIENTATION_TOPLEFT is supported correctly.  This is the
default TIFF and X orientation.  Other orientations will be
displayed incorrectly.

There is no support for or use of 3/3/2 DirectColor visuals.
TIFFTAG_MINSAMPLEVALUE and TIFFTAG_MAXSAMPLEVALUE are not supported.

Only TIFFTAG_BITSPERSAMPLE values that are 1, 2, 4 or 8 are supported.

 Revision History:
 10-Jan-89: Created.
 06-Mar-90: Change to byte encoded rasterfiles.
	      fix bug in call to ReadScanline().
	      fix bug in CVT() macro.
	      fix assignment of td, (missing &).

 Description:
   This program takes a MicroSoft/Aldus "Tagged Image File Format" image or
 "TIFF" file as input and writes a Sun Rasterfile [see rasterfile(5)].  The
 output file may be standard output, but the input TIFF file must be a real
 file since seek(2) is used.
