1. Check the problem from 35421015 is solved:
    % touch a b c
    % gdiff3 a b c
2. Create two test files almost similar and run:
		% diff -u <first_file> <second_file>
3. Use cmp on the same two file as previousily:
		%cmp <first_file> <second_file>
4. Use sdiff to merge the two files in stdout:
		%sdiff <first_file> <second_file>
