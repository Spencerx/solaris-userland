The Gnuplot Plotting Utility
============================

 Gnuplot is a command-line driven interactive function plotting utility
for linux, OSX, MSWin, VMS, and many other platforms.  The software is
copyrighted but freely distributed (i.e., you don't have to pay for it).
It was originally written to allow scientists and students to visualize
mathematical functions and data.  Gnuplot supports output to many types
of terminals, printers, and file formats.  It is easily extensible to
include new devices.

 The "gnu" in gnuplot is NOT related to the Free Software Foundation.
The naming is just a coincidence (and a long story; see the gnuplot FAQ
for details). Thus gnuplot is not covered by the GPL (GNU Public License)
copyleft, but rather by its own copyright statement, included in all source
code files. Some code modules are dual-licensed.

 Gnuplot handles both curves (2 dimensions) and surfaces (3 dimensions).
Surfaces can be plotted as a mesh fitting the specified function, floating
in the 3-d coordinate space, or as a contour plot on the x-y plane.
For 2-d plots, there are also many plot styles including lines, points,
boxes, heat maps, stacked histograms, and contoured projections of 3D data.
Graphs may be labeled with arbitrary labels and arrows, axis labels, 
a title, date and time, and a key.  The interface includes command-line
editing and history on most platforms.

 The new gnuplot user should begin by reading the general information
available by typing `help` after running gnuplot. Then read about the
`plot` command (type `help plot`).  The manual for gnuplot (which is a
nicely formatted version of the on-line help information) is available
as a PDF document, created via LaTeX.  Look at the docs/Makefile
for other options for formatting the documentation.

 The gnuplot source code and executables may be copied and/or modified
freely as long as the copyright messages are left intact.

Copyright and Porting
=====================

 See the Copyright file for copyright conditions.

 Build instructions are in the INSTALL file.  Some additional
information needed to port gnuplot to new platforms not covered by
GNU autoconf can be found in the PORTING file. 

 The code for gnuplot was written with portability in mind, and has been
run on an amazing variety of operating systems and hardware over the years.
However, the current code has not been tested on all those older platforms
and some of the conditional code to support quirks of obsolete compilers
and OS features has been removed.  You can expect that gnuplot will compile
more or less out of the box on any system which has a C compiler compliant
with the c99 standard.  Some optional drivers are written in C++ or lua.

Help and Bug Reports
====================

 Your primary place to go searching for help with gnuplot should
be the project's webpage.  At the time of this writing, that's

	http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net

 It has links to a lot of material, including the project's development
page, also at SourceForge:

	http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuplot/

 There are separate tracking systems for Feature Requests and proposed
patches that implement new features, also hosted at SourceForge.

 All bug reports should include the version of gnuplot you are using,
the operating system and version you are running it on, and the output
device (gnuplot's "terminal") that you are plotting to.  It helps a lot
to provide a simple script, possibly with data, that reproducibly 
demonstrates the problem you are reporting.
 
Mailing Lists
=============

 The gnuplot mailing lists are currently operated through the general
development site on SourceForge.net.  Subscribe to mailing lists via
the web interface at
	
	http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=2055

 The lists you may be interested in are "gnuplot-info" and "gnuplot-beta".
"gnuplot-info" is for general discussion and questions about how to use
the program.  "gnuplot-beta" is for discussion about possible new features,
plans for future work, release schedules, or other development issues.

lnGamma(z) computes the natural logarithm of the Gamma function
valid over the entire complex plane using a Lanczos approximation.
The imaginary component of the result is adjusted to describe a
continuous surface everywhere except the negative real axis.

pgnuplot.c -- pipe stdin to wgnuplot

Version 0.4 -- October 2002

This program is based on pgnuplot.c Copyright (C) 1999 Hans-Bernhard Broeker
with substantial modifications Copyright (C) 1999 Craig R. Schardt.

The code is released to the public domain.

pgnuplot.c -- 'Pipe to gnuplot'  Version 990608

A small program, to be compiled as a Win32 console mode application.
(NB: will not work on 16bit Windows, not even with Win32s installed).

This program will accept commands on STDIN, and pipe them to an
active (or newly created) wgnuplot text window. Command line options
are passed on to wgnuplot.

Effectively, this means `pgnuplot' is an almost complete substitute
for `wgnuplot', on the command line, with the added benefit that it
does accept commands from redirected stdin. (Being a Windows GUI
application, `wgnuplot' itself cannot read stdin at all.)

                      (broeker@physik.rwth-aachen.de)
This file is in the public domain. It might become part of a future
distribution of gnuplot.

based on a program posted to comp.graphics.apps.gnuplot in May 1998 by
jl Hamel <jlhamel@cea.fr>

Changes relative to that original version:
-- doesn't start a new wgnuplot if one already is running.
-- doesn't end up in an endless loop if STDIN is not redirected.
   (refuses to read from STDIN at all, in that case).
-- doesn't stop the wgnuplot session at the end of
   stdin, if it didn't start wgnuplot itself.
-- avoids the usual buffer overrun problem with gets().

For the record, I usually use MinGW32 to compile this, with a
command line looking like this:

    gcc -o pgnuplot.exe pgnuplot.c -luser32 -s

Note that if you're using Cygwin GCC, you'll want to add the option
-mno-cygwin to that command line to avoid getting a pgnuplot.exe
that depends on their GPL'ed cygwin1.dll.

  	Modifications by Craig R. Schardt (17 Jun 1999)

	Copyright (C) 1999 by Craig R. Schardt (craig@silica.mse.ufl.edu)

	Major changes: (See the explanation below for more information)
		+ Always starts a new instance of wgnuplot.
		+ If stdin isn't redirected then start wgnuplot and give it focus.
		+ Uses CreateProcess() instead of WinExec() to start wgnuplot when stdin
		  is redirected.

	Other changes:
		+ New technique for building the command line to pass to wgnuplot.exe
		  which is less complicated and seems to work more reliably than the old
		  technique.
		+ Simplified message passing section of the code.
		+ All printf(...) statements are now fprintf(stderr,...) so that errors
		  are sent to the console, even if stdout is redirected.

	The previous version of pgnuplot would fail when more than one program
	tried to access wgnuplot simultaneously or when one program tried to start
	more than one wgnuplot session. Only a single instance of wgnuplot would be
	started and all input would be sent to that instance. When two or more programs
	tried to pipe input to wgnuplot, the two separate input streams would be sent
	to one wgnuplot window resulting in one very confused copy of wgnuplot. The only
	way to avoid this problem was to change pgnuplot so that it would start a
	new instance of wgnuplot every time.

	Just starting a new instance of wgnuplot isn't enough. pgnuplot must also
	make sure that the data on each stdin pipe is sent to the proper wgnuplot
	instance. This is achieved by using CreateProcess() which returns a handle
	to the newly created process. Once the process has initialized, it can be
	searched for the text window and then data can be routed correctly. The search
	is carried out by the EnumThreadWindows() call and the data passing is carried
	out by a rewritten version of the original code. With these changes, pgnuplot
	now behaves in a manner consistent with the behavior of gnuplot on UNIX
	computers.

	This program has been compiled using Microsoft Visual C++ 4.0 with the
	following command line:

		cl /O2 pgnuplot.c /link user32.lib

	The resulting program has been tested on WinNT and Win98 both by calling
	it directly from the command line with and without redirected input. The
	program also works on WinNT with a modified version of Gnuplot.py (a script
	for interactive control of Gnuplot from Python).

	22 JUN 1999:
	+ Fixed command line code to behave properly when the first
	  item is quoted in the original command line.

	29 JUN 1999:
	+ Added some code to print the command line. This is for testing
	  only and should be removed before the general release. To enable,
	  compile with SHOWCMDLINE defined.

	30 JUN 1999:
	+ New function FindUnquotedSpace() which replaces the earlier technique for
	  finding the command line arguments to send on to wgnuplot. Prior to this
	  the arguments were assumed to start after argv[0], however argv[0] is not
	  set the same by all combinations of compiler, command processor, and OS.
	  The new method ignores argv completely and manually search the command line
	  string for the first space which isn't enclosed in double-quotes.
