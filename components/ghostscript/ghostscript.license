                    GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 19 November 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the software.

  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
source code to the public.

  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
code of the modified version.

  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
this license.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source
shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
following paragraph.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version
3 of the GNU General Public License.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its
interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive
of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different
solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
specific requirements.

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.

                  FreeType font driver for BDF fonts

                       Francesco Zappa Nardelli
                  <francesco.zappa.nardelli@ens.fr>


Introduction
************

BDF (Bitmap Distribution Format) is a bitmap font format defined by Adobe,
which is intended to be easily understood by both humans and computers.
This code implements a BDF driver for the FreeType library, following the
Adobe Specification V 2.2.  The specification of the BDF font format is
available from Adobe's web site:

  https://adobe-type-tools.github.io/font-tech-notes/pdfs/5005.BDF_Spec.pdf

Many good bitmap fonts in bdf format come with XFree86 (www.XFree86.org).
They do not define vertical metrics, because the X Consortium BDF
specification has removed them.


Encodings
*********

[This section is out of date, retained for historical reasons.  BDF
 properties can be retrieved with `FT_Get_BDF_Property`, character set ID
 values with `FT_Get_BDF_Charset_ID`.]

The variety of encodings that accompanies bdf fonts appears to encompass the
small set defined in freetype.h.  On the other hand, two properties that
specify encoding and registry are usually defined in bdf fonts.

I decided to make these two properties directly accessible, leaving to the
client application the work of interpreting them.  For instance:


  #include FT_INTERNAL_BDF_TYPES_H

  FT_Face          face;
  BDF_Public_Face  bdfface;


  FT_New_Face( library, ..., &face );

  bdfface = (BDF_Public_Face)face;

  if ( ( bdfface->charset_registry == "ISO10646" ) &&
       ( bdfface->charset_encoding == "1" )        )
    [..]


Thus the driver always exports `ft_encoding_none' as face->charmap.encoding.
FT_Get_Char_Index's behavior is unmodified, that is, it converts the ULong
value given as argument into the corresponding glyph number.

If the two properties are not available, Adobe Standard Encoding should be
assumed.


Anti-Aliased Bitmaps
********************

The driver supports an extension to the BDF format as used in Mark Leisher's
xmbdfed bitmap font editor.  Microsoft's SBIT tool expects bitmap fonts in
that format for adding anti-aliased them to TrueType fonts.  It introduces a
fourth field to the `SIZE' keyword which gives the bpp value (bits per
pixel) of the glyph data in the font.  Possible values are 1 (the default),
2 (four gray levels), 4 (16 gray levels), and 8 (256 gray levels).  The
driver returns either a bitmap with 1 bit per pixel or a pixmap with 8bits
per pixel (using 4, 16, and 256 gray levels, respectively).


Known problems
**************

- A font is entirely loaded into memory.  Obviously, this is not the Right
  Thing(TM).  If you have big fonts I suggest you convert them into PCF
  format (using the bdftopcf utility): the PCF font drive of FreeType can
  perform incremental glyph loading.

When I have some time, I will implement on-demand glyph parsing.

- Except for encodings properties, client applications have no visibility of
  the PCF_Face object.  This means that applications cannot directly access
  font tables and must trust FreeType.

- Currently, glyph names are ignored.

  I plan to give full visibility of the BDF_Face object in an upcoming
  revision of the driver, thus implementing also glyph names.

- As I have never seen a BDF font that defines vertical metrics, vertical
  metrics are (parsed and) discarded.  If you own a BDF font that defines
  vertical metrics, please let me know (I will implement them in 5-10
  minutes).

find something good in this driver you should probably thank him, not

                  FreeType font driver for PCF fonts

                       Francesco Zappa Nardelli
                  <francesco.zappa.nardelli@ens.fr>


Introduction
************

PCF (Portable Compiled Format) is a binary bitmap font format, largely used
in X world. This code implements a PCF driver for the FreeType library.
Glyph images are loaded into memory only on demand, thus leading to a small
memory footprint.

Information on the PCF font format can only be worked out from
`pcfread.c', and `pcfwrite.c', to be found, for instance, in the XFree86
(www.xfree86.org) source tree (xc/lib/font/bitmap/).

Many good bitmap fonts in bdf format come with XFree86: they can be
compiled into the pcf format using the `bdftopcf' utility.


Supported hardware
******************

The driver has been tested on linux/x86 and sunos5.5/sparc.  In both
cases the compiler was gcc.  When back in Paris, I will test it also
on linux/alpha.


Encodings
*********

Use `FT_Get_BDF_Charset_ID' to access the encoding and registry.

The driver always exports `ft_encoding_none' as face->charmap.encoding.
FT_Get_Char_Index() behavior is unmodified, that is, it converts the ULong
value given as argument into the corresponding glyph number.


Known problems
**************

- dealing explicitly with encodings breaks the uniformity of FreeType 2
  API.

- except for encodings properties, client applications have no
  visibility of the PCF_Face object.  This means that applications
  cannot directly access font tables and are obliged to trust
  FreeType.

- currently, glyph names and ink_metrics are ignored.

I plan to give full visibility of the PCF_Face object in the next
release of the driver, thus implementing also glyph names and
ink_metrics.

- height is defined as (ascent - descent).  Is this correct?

- if unable to read size information from the font, PCF_Init_Face
  sets available_size->width and available_size->height to 12.

- too many english grammar errors in the readme file :-(

the same time the specification and the sample implementation of the
PCF format.  Undoubtedly, this driver is inspired from his work.

		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

        Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

What is pcl3?
=============
pcl3, formerly called hpdj, is a ghostscript device driver for printers
understanding Hewlett-Packard's Printer Command Language, Level 3+ (PCL 3+).
Some printer models (currently exclusively HP DeskJets) are explicitly
supported, but there is also generic support for other PCL-3+ printers.
So far I have not heard of any PCL-3 printer for which the driver cannot be
used at all and it even works for some printers which claim to be
PCL-3-conforming but aren't. For a more positive statement, i.e., a list of
printer models for which pcl3 is currently known to work and how, see the file
doc/reports.txt.



Conditions of use
=================
pcl3 is free software and can be used under the terms of the GNU Lesser General
Public License (LGPL), Version 2.1 (February 1999). You can find a copy of the
LGPL in the pcl3 distribution, in several software packages distributed by the
Free Software Foundation, and at http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html.

This implies in particular that you are using pcl3 AT YOUR OWN RISK!



Status of this release
======================
This is version 3.3 of pcl3, released 2001-08-19. This is an ordinary
(non-beta) release. Read the manual page to learn about the supported
functionality and restrictions.



Files needed
============
First, you need a ghostscript distribution. This version of pcl3 has been
successfully integrated with the following ghostscript distributions:

  - AFPL ghostscript 7.0
  - GNU ghostscript 6.51

Other ghostscript versions than those mentioned here are very likely to work,
too.

To obtain a ghostscript distribution, visit http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost.
You will also need some third-party archives in addition. See the URL just
mentioned or check Make.htm in the ghostscript distribution you have obtained.

Second, you need a font distribution containing at least a basic set of
PostScript fonts. Such a set is distributed with ghostscript as an "std" and an
"other" archive. Because font files are PostScript files, they are normally not
restricted to a particular version of ghostscript although the archives have a
ghostscript version number in their file names. Some of the possibilities are:

      ghostscript-fonts-std-6.0.tar.gz
      ghostscript-fonts-other-6.0.tar.gz
      gnu-gs-fonts-std-6.0.tar.gz
      gnu-gs-fonts-std-5.50.tar.gz
      gnu-gs-fonts-other-6.0.tar.gz
      gnu-gs-fonts-other-5.50.tar.gz

Unless you already have such a set on your system, fetch at least an "std"
archive and choose the one with the highest version number you can readily lay
your hands on. Different file names do not necessarily mean different contents.

  A side remark: The "StandardSymL" font dated 1998-03-26 (first present in
  a 5.10 font archive) contains the Euro glyph. However, it has the wrong
  PostScript name ("euro" instead of "Euro") and the wrong default encoding
  (decimal 240 instead of octal 240). This is corrected in the version dated
  1999-10-21. Ghostscript's "SymbolEncoding" encoding vector had the same bugs
  in gs 5.50 and this was fixed in gs 6.0.

Third, you need the pcl3 distribution:

      pcl3-<version>.tar.gz

But if you are reading this file, you should already have it. If not,
you can obtain the current distribution through the following URL:

      http://home.t-online.de/home/Martin.Lottermoser/pcl3.html

I am distributing pcl3 only in the form of gzipped tar archives. If you wish to
compile pcl3 on a non-UNIX platform, you need gzip, tar (on a Microsoft Windows
system, you can use the Cygnus port of the GNU tools, available from
http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin), and a command to convert text files from
LF-terminated lines to whatever the line termination conventions are on your
system.



How to compile ghostscript with pcl3
====================================
You need an ISO-C-conforming compiler and library in order to compile pcl3.

The following description is heavily biased towards UNIX systems and in
particular Linux.

 1. Unpack the core distribution

    This is the file ghostscript-N.NN.tar or gnu-gs-N.NN.tar. Unpacking it will
    create a subdirectory "gsN.NN" in the current directory.

    In order to clearly identify directories I'm going to use the following
    expressions:
    - "gs directory": the directory gsN.NN you have just created
    - "documentation directory": In gs 5.50 this is identical to the
      gs directory, in newer versions it is the subdirectory "doc" in the
      gs directory.
    - "source directory": In gs 5.50 this is identical to the gs directory,
      in newer versions it is the subdirectory "src" in the gs directory.

 2. Read Make.htm in the documentation directory on how to compile ghostscript.
    In particular, you should learn

      - which other files you need to unpack and how, and
      - what the platform-specific make file for your platform is.

 3. Unpack the other files needed (except the font files) as directed by
    Make.htm.

 4. Unpack pcl3, preferably in the gs directory. The file pcl3-<version>.tar
    unpacks into a subdirectory pcl3-<version> with only three files:

	README-cover
	pcl3.tar	the distribution proper
	pcl3.tar.sig	an OpenPGP signature for pcl3.tar

    Make the directory accessible under the name "pcl3" from the gs directory,
    either by renaming it or by creating an appropriate symbolic link. Then
    change into the pcl3 directory and unpack pcl3.tar from there. This should
    give you in addition the following regular files in that directory:

	BUGS		pcl3's bug list
	LGPL		text of the GNU LGPL
	NEWS		list of user-visible changes between versions
	README		this file

    Furthermore, a number of subdirectories will have been created:

	doc		documentation
        eprn            C source code for the eprn device on which pcl3 is based
	lib		cups-pcl3, example.mcf, if-pcl3
        ppd             PostScript printer description files
	ps		PostScript files
	src		C source code and build files for pcl3

 5. Extend contrib.mak in the source directory.

    The pcl3 distribution contains extension files "src/contrib.mak-N.NN.add"
    for this purpose, where "N.NN" is a ghostscript version (at least for all
    ghostscript distributions listed in "Files needed" above). These files
    contain text to be inserted into contrib.mak at some point, for example at
    the end. An extension file might work for other gs versions in addition to
    the designated one.

    The extension files contain an initial comment which gives you some
    further instructions (compile options, files shared with hpdj, available
    devices).

 6. Add at least "$(DD)pcl3.dev" ("pcl3.dev" in gs 5.50) to one of the
    DEVICE_DEVS* variables in the platform-specific make file. The conventional
    place is DEVICE_DEVS3, DEVICE_DEVS4, or DEVICE_DEVS5. For a complete list
    of pcl3 devices you can define here, see the contrib.mak-N.NN.add file.
    You might also wish to modify the device and feature lists in other
    respects.

    On a Linux system, the file to edit is unix-gcc.mak.

 7. Read the file doc/gs-mods.txt about modifications I suggest for making in
    ghostscript's source code or configuration files.

 8. Other changes to the platform-specific make file

    For a UNIX system and if you wish to install the software in a non-default
    directory, edit the make variable "prefix" (normally /usr/local).
    This directory must exist before step 10.

    If you intend to use the X Window System, check whether the values for the
    variables XINCLUDE, XLIBDIRS, and XLIBS are correct. On Linux, they should
    usually be "-I/usr/X11R6/include", "-L/usr/X11R6/lib", and
    "Xt SM ICE Xext X11", respectively. You can ignore XINCLUDE if one of the
    directories searched by the compiler anyway contains an appropriate "X11"
    subdirectory (e.g., there is a link from /usr/include/X11 to
    /usr/X11R6/include/X11).

 9. On a UNIX system, check that the platform-specific make file (unix-gcc.mak
    for Linux) is available to make from the gs directory (or use "-f"). Then,
    in the gs directory, type "make" to generate the gs binary, and
    "make pcl3opts" to generate the pcl3opts binary. The latter step is likely
    to fail if you are not on an XPG-conforming UNIX system.

10. Install: "make install pcl3-install".

    If you are not on a UNIX system, you'll probably have to omit the
    "pcl3-install" part. Instead, copy pcl3's doc/*.html files and the compiled
    pcl3opts binary (provided it did compile) to appropriate places yourself.

    If "make pcl3-install" gives you a usage message from the "instcopy"
    command you've forgotten "make pcl3opts" in step 9.

    The "make pcl3opts" call, if successful, has also generated two NLS message
    catalogues for pcl3opts in ghostscript's object file directory ("obj" in
    the gs directory): pcl3opts-en.cat (English) and pcl3opts-de.cat (German).
    These catalogues are not installed automatically. If you wish to use them,
    copy each file into an appropriate NLS directory under a name matching your
    NLSPATH conventions with "pcl3opts" for %N. (On Linux the default value for
    NLSPATH usually includes /usr/share/locale/%L/%N and
    /usr/share/locale/%L/LC_MESSAGES/%N.) You need the English catalogue only
    if you want pcl3opts to issue media sizes in inches instead of millimetres.

    Note that pcl3's PostScript example files (subdirectory "ps") are also not
    installed. If you find them useful, copy them to an appropriate place
    yourself.

11. Install the fonts.

    First call the newly generated "gs" with the option "-h". The output will
    show you ghostscript's search path. The fonts should be present in one of
    these directories. On UNIX systems, the convention is to use a ".../fonts"
    directory for this purpose. Note that newer font distributions unpack into
    "./fonts" and some older ones into ".".

    If you already have a ghostscript installation somewhere else on your
    system and its font directory is not included in the font path of your new
    gs binary, you can create a symbolic link from the ".../fonts" directory to
    your installed fonts, or use the environment variable GS_FONTPATH to direct
    gs to the directory/ies in question.

12. This is a good point to take a first look at pcl3's documentation if you
    haven't done that yet. It is available as a manual page (type "man gs-pcl3")
    and in HTML format (open gs-pcl3.html in the installed ghostscript's
    documentation directory with an HTML browser).

13. If your printer is not directly supported by pcl3 and you wish the driver
    to be correctly informed about supported media sizes and the associated
    hardware margins, look into the file lib/example.mcf and then create a
    media configuration file for your printer from information in its manual.
    You must at least specify an entry for the default page size (A4 or
    US Letter as selected in your ghostscript configuration).

    If you have selected to set PCL3_MEDIA_FILE in step 5, the media file
    you have just created should be installed under that path name.

14. Integration with a spool system

    This depends on your spooler :-). The minimum you need is the ability to
    print a file without any modifications by spool commands. In that case
    you can generate a PCL file by calling ghostscript with option values
    appropriate for your current needs and pass the generated file through the
    spool system for printing. Such spool queues are usually called "raw"
    queues.

    If you are using CUPS (Common UNIX Printing System, http://www.cups.org),
    you can proceed as follows:

      - Create a file ppd/gs.ppd describing the site-specific properties of
        your ghostscript installation.
      - Select a PPD file suitable for your printer model and copy it into
	CUPS' "model" directory using the ppd/catppd script.
      - Copy the lib/cups-pcl3 filter to CUPS' "filter" directory.
      - Install a new print queue based on the new PPD file.

    The details of the first two steps are described in the ppd/README file.
    You should also at some stage read the initial comments in lib/cups-pcl3.

    Most Linux systems still use a Berkeley spooler (lpr/lprm/lpq) which maps
    the queue name in the print request to a call to some backend command,
    based on /etc/printcap. Frequently, the backend is an intelligent filter
    which will examine the contents of the file to be printed and perform
    appropriate processing based on the file type.

    Because with an ordinary Berkeley spooler one cannot pass command line
    options to the backend, it is a good idea to install several print queues
    for those option combinations one needs frequently. You could for example
    install seven print queues: one for passing any file to the printer
    unchanged, three for monochrome and three for colour printing, each of the
    last two groups having a queue for "draft", "normal" and "presentation"
    quality.

    If you are on a machine with an AT&T spool system (lp/cancel/lpstat),
    one queue can be sufficient because you can pass command line options to
    the backend. However, if your printer has different hardware configurations
    (either black or CMY cartridge, either banner or tray feed) and you cannot
    completely control when print jobs are submitted, you should still install
    separate queues for these configurations, take steps to make it at least
    likely that the jobs submitted to each queue have the necessary properties,
    and enable only the queue agreeing with the printer's current configuration.

    You also need only one queue independent of the spool system if you have a
    spooler frontend capable of inserting PostScript setup commands into the
    document to be printed or if such a document manager is part of your
    spooler (the latter applies to CUPS). The pcl3 distribution contains the
    necessary PPD files for these cases; read the file ppd/README for further
    instructions. Note that the remarks above on separate queues for distinct
    hardware configurations apply also to this case.

    The pcl3 distribution contains configurable input filters for the Berkeley
    spooler and for CUPS in the files "lib/if-pcl3" and "lib/cups-pcl3",
    respectively. Read the initial comments in these files for further
    instructions.

    You should also not forget to skim the "OPTIONS" and "CONFIGURATION"
    sections in pcl3's manual page: some parts are particularly relevant for
    spooler backends.

15. Test your configuration by printing a few example documents.

    As a first step and in particular when you are using a media configuration
    file, print some of the margin test files ps/margins-*.ps appropriate for
    your current media size. They should show marks with a distance of 25 mm or
    1 in (depending on the media size) from the margins. If you find deviations
    from what you expect, read the manual page and in particular the
    description of how to use the "Margins" or "PageOffset" entries to correct
    misalignments.

    For trying out various rendering parameters, ps/levels-test.ps is a good
    test file, in particular if you print through a spooler, because the
    printed page will tell you which settings were effective.

Purpose and Format of PPD Files, Document Managers
**************************************************
Some PostScript commands (e.g., for duplex printing) are not concerned with
what appears on the page but control the way a document is printed independent
of its contents. Such commands are usually not created by the application
generating the PostScript document but are inserted at the user's request when
actually printing the file. In addition, some PostScript interpreters differ in
the commands needed to achieve a particular effect, hence a PostScript file
might have to be adapted for a certain device if it was orginally generated for
a different one. This post-processing of PostScript files is the job of a
PostScript "document manager" or "print manager". It obtains its information
from a PPD (PostScript Printer Description) file for the printer selected.

The most useful kind of document manager is a preprocessor for a spooler. This
preprocessor parses the PostScript file to determine its current settings, asks
the user which special features (e.g., duplex printing, output quality,
stapling, etc.) are desired, extends or modifies the file with commands
extracted from the PPD file, and passes the modified file to the spooler.

There exist also spooler-integrated document managers where the user interface
is detached from the editing component; in these cases the interface passes the
information it has collected to the spooling interface in some spooler-specific
manner and later a backend inserts appropriate PostScript commands.

Primitive document manager implementations don't bother about parsing the
PostScript file but merely prepend the new PostScript commands to the file;
such commands will not take effect if the file already contains invocations of
the same feature. Beware of this in particular in the case of Windows-generated
PostScript files which usually contain explicit settings for the resolution.
You might consider adding definitions for ghostscript's FIXEDRESOLUTION
variable to the *Resolution statements in the PPD file if you have such a
document manager.

PPD files contain also some information which is relevant for software
generating PostScript files. A case in point is the list of supported media
sizes: it can be used by PostScript-generating programs to present a user with
a list of choices for the document to be composed, and it is also used by the
document manager to replace the size's invocation code with the commands
required to obtain this size on the printer selected. It can be confusing if
you have a PPD-based user interface to a print system which accepts PostScript
as well as non-PostScript files and where the interface does not clearly
distinguish between these two steps (document composition and printing); you
might get the impression that you can alter the page size after the PostScript
file has been generated. (A similar case is page orientation.) Actually,
PostScript does provide functionality for doing this (PageSize recovery
policies), but altering the size selection commands is logically wrong and does
not give a usable result in general.

The PPD file format is defined by Adobe:

      Adobe Systems Incorporated
      "PostScript Printer Description File Format Specification"
      Version 4.3
      9 February 1996
      Document ID: PN LPS5003

This specification can be obtained from http://www.adobe.com.



The PPD Files for pcl3
**********************
The PPD files distributed with pcl3 are not complete descriptions of the
devices implemented by ghostscript with the pcl3 driver. Their main purpose is
to provide some essential support for document managers acting as
preprocessors. This makes it possible to create printing interfaces which are
easier to use than ghostscript's command line interface. As a consequence,
you will find no *OpenUI/*CloseUI entries for device parameters like
"SendBlackLast" or "PJLLanguage": the values of these parameters are not
job-specific but printer-specific properties and should be given as additions
in other PPD statements or in the call to ghostscript.

PPD files can include other PPD files. For pcl3, the include structure looks
like this (inclusion is from top to bottom):

	gs-pcl3-<subdevice>.ppd
	|
	gs-pcl3-common.ppd
	|
	gs.ppd
	|
	gs-<gs version>.ppd
	|
	gs-common.ppd

Several of the files gs-pcl3-<subdevice>.ppd and in particular those where
<subdevice> is not an acceptable argument to "-sSubdevice" are valid for
several subdevices. If you are unsure which file to select, check the initial
comments or the *ModelName statement in a file to discover the subdevices
supported by that file.

The gs-pcl3-<subdevice>.ppd files assume that the PostScript file generated by
the document manager is passed to a ghostscript executable with options
selecting pcl3 and the intended subdevice and without altering the default
state of the device as far as it is reflected in the PPD file. If this does not
agree with your environment, use a local PPD customization file for the
necessary adaptations.

If you're using CUPS, device and subdevice selection should happen via the
*cupsFilter statement and the filter called. The gs-pcl3-<subdevice>.ppd files
already contain *cupsFilter statements using the cups-pcl3 filter. If you're
using a different filter, modify the statements as needed, otherwise read the
initial comments in the file cups-pcl3.


Installation of the Files
*************************

1.  Create a file called gs.ppd for describing site-specific settings of your
    ghostscript installation. It should contain at least the following
    statements:

      *PPD-Adobe: "4.3"
      *DefaultPaperDimension: <size>
      *Include: "gs-<gs version>.ppd"

    Replace "<size>" with the default page size configured for your ghostscript
    installation. Usually, this is either "A4" or "Letter". In the case of A4
    you would therefore write:

      *DefaultPaperDimension: A4

    You might also wish to insert other statements here which describe settings
    which are relevant for a document manager. For example, if your document
    manager downloads fonts to the PostScript interpreter if it is of the
    opinion that the latter does not have a particular font used in a document
    (this is the case for CUPS), you should compose a PPD file with a list of
    fonts accessible to your ghostscript installation and insert it or an
    *Include statement for it at this point. You can use the fonts.ppd file in
    this directory as a model (or as a temporary substitute); it contains a
    list of ghostscript's usual standard fonts. If the programs accessing the
    PPD file use it only for determining whether a font is accessible to the
    interpreter or not, you can also simply use the list of font descriptions
    resulting from running gs on:

      /scratch 200 string def
      (*)
      {
	(*Font ) print print (: Standard "\(0.0\)" Standard Disk\n) print
      }
      scratch /Font resourceforall

    (put this into a file and run "gs -q -dBATCH -sDEVICE=bit" on it). This
    output will contain information which is wrong, but it will list all fonts
    known to your ghostscript installation.

    Don't forget to also replace <gs version> with your ghostscript's version
    number. If there is no gs-<gs version>.ppd file for your gs version, use
    one of the existing gs-<gs version>.ppd files as a model.

2.  The PPD specification distinguishes between printer models (e.g., the
    HP DeskJet 540) and printer instances (e.g., the second printer in
    room 12). The PPD file for an instance can be generated by creating a local
    instance-specific customization file which includes the model's PPD file.

    If your document manager has an interface for instance installation, it is
    sufficient to give it the relevant gs-pcl3-<subdevice>.ppd files which
    describe models. Otherwise you usually have to create a customization file
    under the name of the instance, containing just

      *PPD-Adobe: "4.3"
      *ShortNickName: "<short text>"
      *NickName: "<text>"
      *Include: "gs-pcl3-<subdevice>.ppd"

    with <text> describing the printer instance (<short text> should basically
    have the same content but consist of at most 31 characters) and <subdevice>
    being replaced to generate the name of the pcl3 PPD file you wish to use
    for this printer.

    If you wish to extend or override other settings in the
    gs-pcl3-<subdevice>.ppd file, add these statements in the customization
    file between the first and the last statement above.

    The pcl3 PPD files contain *InputSlot definitions only for those media
    sources ("Cassette" and "ManualFeed") which are available independent of
    your "InputAttributes" definitions. If you configure a print queue such
    that other sources are available as well, read the comments on the
    *InputSlot entry in gs-pcl3-common.ppd.

    You can't use local customization files with CUPS up to at least version
    1.1.8 because the CUPS PPD scanner (a) does not support the *Include
    statement and (b) violates the PPD specification in either taking the
    last occurrence of a keyword as the correct instance or collecting all
    instances instead of disregarding every except the first. Modify the
    installed instance files in this case if you need some customization, for
    example to change the "*NickName" value (which actually CUPS should do when
    you give it a description for the print queue at creation time).

3.  Copy all PPD files needed into a directory where they will be found by your
    document manager.

    If your document manager does not support the "*Include" statement, use the
    script "catppd" for this purpose:

	catppd <top PPD file> <target directory or file>

    The script requires that all the files referenced from <top PPD file> must
    be accessible from the current working directory under the name given in
    the "*Include" statement. In the case of pcl3's PPD files this means that
    you must call it from the "ppd" directory. If you are installing model
    files you may specify any gs-pcl3-*.ppd file for <top PPD file> with the
    exception of gs-pcl3-common.ppd. If you are installing instance files, use
    catppd only on your customization files.

    For CUPS up to at least version 1.1.8 you'll have to use catppd and you
    should copy the files into the .../cups/model directory. You must also
    remove the second "*OpenUI *MediaType: ... *CloseUI *MediaType" section
    from the copied gs-pcl3-unspec.ppd file.

4.  If you are using the "unspec" or "unspecold" subdevices, check whether the
    PPD file supports all the features you need. You will also almost certainly
    find some features or values there which are not supported by your printer.
    It is probably best to create your own PPD file in this case.

INTRODUCTION

CUPS(tm) is provided under the GNU General Public License ("GPL")
and GNU Library General Public License ("LGPL"), Version 2, with
exceptions for Apple operating systems and the OpenSSL toolkit. A
copy of the exceptions and licenses follow this introduction.

The GNU LGPL applies to the CUPS and CUPS Imaging libraries
located in the "cups" and "filter" subdirectories of the CUPS
source distribution and the files in the "test" subdirectory. The
GNU GPL applies to the remainder of the CUPS distribution.

For those not familiar with the GNU GPL, the license basically
allows you to:

   - Use the CUPS software at no charge.
   - Distribute verbatim copies of the software in source or
     binary form.
   - Sell verbatim copies of the software for a media fee, or
     sell support for the software.

What this license *does not* allow you to do is make changes or
add features to CUPS and then sell a binary distribution without
source code. You must provide source for any changes or additions
to the software, and all code must be provided under the GPL or
LGPL as appropriate. The only exceptions to this are the portions
of the CUPS software covered by the Apple operating system
license exceptions outlined later in this license agreement.

The GNU LGPL relaxes the "link-to" restriction, allowing you to
develop applications that use the CUPS and CUPS Imaging libraries
under other licenses and/or conditions as appropriate for your
application, driver, or filter.


LICENSE EXCEPTIONS

In addition, as the copyright holder of CUPS, Apple Inc. grants
the following special exceptions:

     1. Apple Operating System Development License Exception;

	a. Software that is developed by any person or entity
	   for an Apple Operating System ("Apple OS-Developed
	   Software"), including but not limited to Apple and
	   third party printer drivers, filters, and backends
	   for an Apple Operating System, that is linked to the
	   CUPS imaging library or based on any sample filters
	   or backends provided with CUPS shall not be
	   considered to be a derivative work or collective work
	   based on the CUPS program and is exempt from the
	   mandatory source code release clauses of the GNU GPL.
	   You may therefore distribute linked combinations of
	   the CUPS imaging library with Apple OS-Developed
	   Software without releasing the source code of the
	   Apple OS-Developed Software. You may also use sample
	   filters and backends provided with CUPS to develop
	   Apple OS-Developed Software without releasing the
	   source code of the Apple OS-Developed Software.

	b. An Apple Operating System means any operating system
	   software developed and/or marketed by Apple Inc.,
	   including but not limited to all existing releases and
	   versions of Apple's Darwin, OS X, and OS X Server
	   products and all follow-on releases and future
	   versions thereof.

	c. This exception is only available for Apple
	   OS-Developed Software and does not apply to software
	   that is distributed for use on other operating
	   systems.

	d. All CUPS software that falls under this license
	   exception have the following text at the top of each
	   source file:

	     This file is subject to the Apple OS-Developed
	     Software exception.

     2. OpenSSL Toolkit License Exception;

	a. Apple Inc. explicitly allows the compilation and
	   distribution of the CUPS software with the OpenSSL
	   Toolkit.

No developer is required to provide these exceptions in a
derived work.


KERBEROS SUPPORT CODE

The Kerberos support code ("KSC") is copyright 2006 by Jelmer
Vernooij and is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied
warranty.  In no event will the author or Apple Inc. be held
liable for any damages arising from the use of the KSC.

Sources files containing KSC have the following text at the top
of each source file:

     This file contains Kerberos support code, copyright 2006 by
     Jelmer Vernooij.

The KSC copyright and license apply only to Kerberos-related
feature code in CUPS.  Such code is typically conditionally
compiled based on the present of the HAVE_GSSAPI preprocessor
definition.

Permission is granted to anyone to use the KSC for any purpose,
including commercial applications, and to alter it and
redistribute it freely, subject to the following restrictions:

     1. The origin of the KSC must not be misrepresented; you
	must not claim that you wrote the original software. If
	you use the KSC in a product, an acknowledgment in the
	product documentation would be appreciated but is not
	required.

     2. Altered source versions must be plainly marked as such,
	and must not be misrepresented as being the original
	software.

     3. This notice may not be removed or altered from any source
	distribution.


TRADEMARKS

CUPS and the CUPS logo (the "CUPS Marks") are trademarks of Apple

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                       59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

	Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
			 Version 2, June 1991

	  Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
       59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

    [This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
   numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

			       Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
your libraries, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
the original authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
free use or not licensed at all.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
the same as in the ordinary license.

  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
treats it as such.

  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.

  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
will lead to faster development of free libraries.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
works together with the library.

  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
General Public License rather than by this special one.

		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

     Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

FREETYPE LICENSES
-----------------

The FreeType  2 font  engine is  copyrighted work  and cannot  be used
legally without  a software  license.  In order  to make  this project
usable to  a vast majority of  developers, we distribute it  under two
mutually exclusive open-source licenses.

This means that *you* must choose  *one* of the two licenses described
below, then obey all its terms and conditions when using FreeType 2 in
any of your projects or products.

  - The FreeType License,  found in the file  `docs/FTL.TXT`, which is
    similar to the  original BSD license *with*  an advertising clause
    that forces  you to explicitly  cite the FreeType project  in your
    product's  documentation.  All  details are  in the  license file.
    This license is suited to products which don't use the GNU General
    Public License.

    Note that  this license  is compatible to  the GNU  General Public
    License version 3, but not version 2.

FreeType 2.13.0
===============

Homepage: https://www.freetype.org

FreeType is a freely available software library to render fonts.

It  is  written  in  C,   designed  to  be  small,  efficient,  highly
customizable,  and portable  while capable  of producing  high-quality
output (glyph images) of most vector and bitmap font formats.

Please   read  the   `docs/CHANGES`   file,   it  contains   IMPORTANT
INFORMATION.

Read the files `docs/INSTALL*`  for installation instructions; see the
file `docs/LICENSE.TXT` for the available licenses.

For using FreeType's git repository  instead of a distribution bundle,
please read file  `README.git`.  Note that you have  to actually clone
the repository; using a snapshot will  not work (in other words, don't
use gitlab's 'Download' button).

The FreeType 2 API reference is located in directory `docs/reference`;
use the file  `index.html` as the top entry point.   [Please note that
currently  the search  function  for  locally installed  documentation
doesn't work due to cross-site scripting issues.]

Additional documentation is  available as a separate  package from our
sites.  Go to

The makefile.os4 is for the AmigaOS4 SDK.  To use it, type
"make -f makefile.os4", it produces a link library libft2_ppc.a.

The makefile is for ppc-morphos-gcc-2.95.3-bin.tgz (gcc 2.95.3 hosted on
68k-Amiga producing MorphOS-PPC-binaries from http://www.morphos.de).
To use it, type "make assign", then "make"; it produces a link library
libft2_ppc.a.

The smakefile is a makefile for Amiga SAS/C 6.58 (no longer available,
latest sold version was 6.50, updates can be found in Aminet).  It is
based on the version found in the sourcecode of ttf.library 0.83b for
FreeType 1.3.1 from Richard Griffith (ragriffi@sprynet.com,
http://ragriffi.home.sprynet.com).

You will also need the latest include files and amiga.lib from the
Amiga web site (https://os.amigaworld.de/download.php?id=3) for
AmigaOS 3.9; the generated code should work under AmigaOS 2.04 and up.

To use it, call "smake assign" and then "smake" from the builds/amiga
directory.  The results are:

- A link library "ft2_680x0.lib" (where x depends on the setting of
  the CPU entry in the smakefile) containing all FreeType2 parts
  except of the init code, debugging code, and the system interface
  code.

- ftsystem.o, an object module containing the standard version of the
  system interface code which uses fopen() fclose() fread() fseek()
  ftell() malloc() realloc() and free() from lib:sc.lib (not pure).

- ftsystempure.o, an object module containing the pure version of the
  system interface code which uses Open() Close() Read() Seek()
  ExamineFH() AsmAllocPooled() AsmFreePooled() etc.  This version can
  be used in both normal programs and in Amiga run-time shared system
  librarys (can be linked with lib:libinit.o, no copying of DATA and
  BSS hunks for each OpenLibrary() necessary).  Source code is in
  src/base/ftsystem.c.

- ftdebug.o, an object module containing the standard version of the
  debugging code which uses vprintf() and exit() (not pure).
  Debugging can be turned on in FT:include/freetype/config/ftoption.h
  and with FT_SetTraceLevel().

- ftdebugpure.o, an object module containing the pure version of the
  debugging code which uses KVPrintf() from lib:debug.lib and no
  exit().  For debugging of Amiga run-time shared system libraries.
  Source code is in src/base/ftdebug.c.

- NO ftinit.o.  Because linking with a link library should result in
  linking only the needed object modules in it, but standard
  ftsystem.o would force ALL FreeType2 modules to be linked to your
  program, I decided to use a different scheme: You must #include
  FT:src/base/ftinit.c in your sourcecode and specify with #define
  statements which modules you need.  See
  include/freetype/config/ftmodule.h.


To use in your own programs:

- Insert the #define and #include statements from top of
  include/freetype/config/ftmodule.h in your source code and
  uncomment the #define statements for the FreeType2 modules you need.

- You can use either PARAMETERS=REGISTER or PARAMETERS=STACK for
  calling the FreeType2 functions, because the link library and the
  object files are compiled with PARAMETERS=BOTH.

- "smake assign" (assign "FT:" to the FreeType2 main directory).

- Compile your program.

- Link with either ftsystem.o or ftsystempure.o, if debugging enabled
  with either ftdebug.o or (ftdebugpure.o and lib:debug.lib), and with
  ft2_680x0.lib as link library.


To adapt to other compilers:

- The standard ANSI C maximum length of 31 significant characters in
  identifiers is not enough for FreeType2.  Check if your compiler has
  a minimum length of 40 significant characters or can be switched to
  it.  "idlen=40" is the option for SAS/C.  Setting #define
  HAVE_LIMIT_ON_IDENTS in an include file may also work (not tested).

- Make sure that the include directory in builds/amiga is searched
  before the normal FreeType2 include directory, so you are able to
  replace problematic include files with your own version (same may be
  useful for the src directory).

- An example of how to replace/workaround a problematic include file
  is include/freetype/config/ftconfig.h; it changes a #define that
  would prevent SAS/C from generating XDEF's where it should do that and
  then includes the standard FreeType2 include file.

gxvalid: TrueType GX validator
==============================


1. What is this
---------------

  `gxvalid' is a module to  validate TrueType GX tables: a collection of
  additional tables  in TrueType  font which are  used by  `QuickDraw GX
  Text',  Apple Advanced  Typography  (AAT).  In  addition, gxvalid  can
  validates `kern'  tables which have  been extended for AAT.   Like the
  otvalid  module,   gxvalid  uses   FreeType  2's  validator  framework
  (ftvalid).

  You can link gxvalid with your program; before running your own layout
  engine, gxvalid validates a font  file.  As the result, you can remove
  error-checking code  from the layout  engine.  It is also  possible to
  use  gxvalid  as a  stand-alone  font  validator;  the `ftvalid'  test
  program  included  in the  ft2demo  bundle  calls gxvalid  internally.
  A stand-alone font validator may be useful for font developers.

  This documents documents the following issues.

  - supported TrueType GX tables
  - fundamental validation limitations
  - permissive error handling of broken GX tables
  - `kern' table issue.


2. Supported tables
-------------------

  The following GX tables are currently supported.

    bsln
    feat
    just
    kern(*)
    lcar
    mort
    morx
    opbd
    prop
    trak

  The following GX tables are currently unsupported.

    cvar
    fdsc
    fmtx
    fvar
    gvar
    Zapf

  The following GX tables won't be supported.

    acnt(**)
    hsty(***)

  The following undocumented tables in TrueType fonts designed for Apple
  platform aren't handled either.

    addg
    CVTM
    TPNM
    umif


  *)   The `kern'  validator handles both  the classic and the  new kern
       formats;  the former  is supported  on both  Microsoft  and Apple
       platforms, while the latter is supported on Apple platforms.

  **)  `acnt' tables are not supported by currently available Apple font
       tools.

  ***) There  is  one more  Apple  extension,  `hsty',  but  it  is  for
       Newton-OS, not GX  (Newton-OS is a platform by  Apple, but it can
       use  sfnt- housed bitmap  fonts only).   Therefore, it  should be
       excluded  from  `Apple  platform'  in the  context  of  TrueType.
       gxvalid ignores it as Apple font tools do so.


  We have  checked 183  fonts bundled with  MacOS 9.1, MacOS  9.2, MacOS
  10.0, MacOS X 10.1, MSIE  for MacOS, and AppleWorks 6.0.  In addition,
  we have  checked 67 Dynalab fonts  (designed for MacOS)  and 189 Ricoh
  fonts (designed for Windows and  MacOS dual platforms).  The number of
  fonts including TrueType GX tables are as follows.

    bsln:  76
    feat: 191
    just:  84
    kern:  59
    lcar:   4
    mort: 326
    morx:  19
    opbd:   4
    prop: 114
    trak:  16

  Dynalab  and Ricoh fonts  don't have  GX tables  except of  `feat' and
  `mort'.


3. Fundamental validation limitations
-------------------------------------

  TrueType  GX  provides  layout   information  to  libraries  for  font
  rasterizers  and text layout.   gxvalid can  check whether  the layout
  data in  a font is conformant  to the TrueType GX  format specified by
  Apple.  But gxvalid cannot check  a how QuickDraw GX/AAT renderer uses
  the stored information.

  3-1. Validation of State Machine activity
  -----------------------------------------

    QuickDraw GX/AAT uses a `State Machine' to provide `stateful' layout
    features,  and TrueType GX  stores the  state transition  diagram of
    this `State  Machine' in a  `StateTable' data structure.   While the
    State  Machine receives  a series  of glyph  IDs, the  State Machine
    starts with `start  of text' state, walks around  various states and
    generates various  layout information  to the  renderer, and finally
    reaches the `end of text' state.

    gxvalid can check essential errors like:

      - possibility of state transitions to undefined states
      - existence of glyph  IDs that the State Machine  doesn't know how
        to handle
      - the  State Machine  cannot compute  the layout  information from
        given diagram

    These errors  can be  checked within finite  steps, and  without the
    State Machine itself, because these are `expression' errors of state
    transition diagram.

    There  is no  limitation  about  how long  the  State Machine  walks
    around,  so validation  of  the algorithm  in  the state  transition
    diagram requires infinite  steps, even if we had  a State Machine in
    gxvalid.   Therefore, the  following errors  and problems  cannot be
    checked.

      - existence of states which the State Machine never transits to
      - the  possibility that the  State Machine  never reaches  `end of
        text'
      - the possibility of stack underflow/overflow in the State Machine
        (in  ligature  and  contextual  glyph substitutions,  the  State
        Machine can store 16 glyphs onto its stack)

    In addition, gxvalid doesn't check `temporary glyph IDs' used in the
    chained State Machines  (in `mort' and `morx' tables).   If a layout
    feature  is  implemented by  a  single  State  Machine, a  glyph  ID
    converted by the State Machine is passed to the glyph renderer, thus
    it  should not  point to  an undefined  glyph ID.   But if  a layout
    feature is implemented by  chained State Machines, a component State
    Machine  (if it  is  not the  final  one) is  permitted to  generate
    undefined glyph IDs for temporary use, because it is handled by next
    component State Machine and not  by the glyph renderer.  To validate
    such temporary glyph IDs, gxvalid must stack all undefined glyph IDs
    which  can occur in  the output  of the  previous State  Machine and
    search  them in  the  `ClassTable' structure  of  the current  State
    Machine.  It is too complex to  list all possible glyph IDs from the
    StateTable, especially from a ligature substitution table.

  3-2. Validation of relationship between multiple layout features
  ----------------------------------------------------------------

    gxvalid does  not validate the relationship  between multiple layout
    features at all.

    If  multiple layout  features  are defined  in  TrueType GX  tables,
    possible  interactions,  overrides,  and  conflicts  between  layout
    features are implicitly  given in the font too.   For example, there
    are several predefined spacing control features:

      - Text Spacing          (Proportional/Monospace/Half-width/Normal)
      - Number Spacing        (Monospaced-numbers/Proportional-numbers)
      - Kana Spacing          (Full-width/Proportional)
      - Ideographic Spacing   (Full-width/Proportional)
      - CJK Roman Spacing     (Half-width/Proportional/Default-roman
                               /Full-width-roman/Proportional)

    If all  layout features are  independently managed, we  can activate
    inconsistent  typographic rules  like  `Text Spacing=Monospace'  and
    `Ideographic Spacing=Proportional' at the same time.

    The combinations  of layout features  is managed by a  32bit integer
    (one bit each for selector  setting), so we can define relationships
    between  up  to 32  features,  theoretically.   But  if one  feature
    setting  affects  another   feature  setting,  we  need  typographic
    priority  rules to  validate the  relationship.   Unfortunately, the
    TrueType GX format specification does not give such information even
    for predefined features.


4. Permissive error handling of broken GX tables
------------------------------------------------

  When  Apple's font  rendering system  finds an  inconsistency,  like a
  specification  violation or  an  unspecified value  in  a TrueType  GX
  table, it does not always  return error.  In most cases, the rendering
  engine silently  ignores such wrong  values or even whole  tables.  In
  fact, MacOS is shipped with  fonts including broken GX/AAT tables, but
  no harmful  effects due to  `officially broken' fonts are  observed by
  end-users.

  gxvalid  is designed  to continue  the validation  process as  long as
  possible.  When gxvalid find wrong  values, gxvalid warns it at least,
  and takes  a fallback procedure  if possible.  The  fallback procedure
  depends on the debug level.

  We used the following three tools to investigate Apple's error handling.

    - FontValidator  (for MacOS 8.5 - 9.2)  resource fork font
    - ftxvalidator   (for MacOS X 10.1 -)   dfont or naked-sfnt
    - ftxdumperfuser (for MacOS X 10.1 -)   dfont or naked-sfnt

  However, all tests were done on a PowerPC based Macintosh; at present,
  we have not checked those tools on a m68k-based Macintosh.

  In total, we checked 183 fonts  bundled to MacOS 9.1, MacOS 9.2, MacOS
  10.0, MacOS X  10.1, MSIE for MacOS, and  AppleWorks 6.0.  These fonts
  are distributed  officially, but many broken GX/AAT  tables were found
  by Apple's font tools.  In the following, we list typical violation of
  the GX specification, in fonts officially distributed with those Apple
  systems.

  4-1. broken BinSrchHeader (19/183)
  ----------------------------------

    `BinSrchHeader' is  a header of a  data array for  m68k platforms to
    access memory efficiently.  Although  there are only two independent
    parameters  for real  (`unitSize' and  `nUnits'),  BinSrchHeader has
    three additional parameters which  can be calculated from `unitSize'
    and  `nUnits',  for  fast  setup.   Apple  font  tools  ignore  them
    silently, so gxvalid warns if it finds and inconsistency, and always
    continues  validation.    The  additional  parameters   are  ignored
    regardless of the consistency.

      19  fonts include  such  inconsistencies; all  breaks  are in  the
      BinSrchHeader structure of the `kern' table.

  4-2. too-short LookupTable (5/183)
  ----------------------------------

    LookupTable format 0  is a simple array to get a  value from a given
    GID (glyph  ID); the index of  this array is a  GID too.  Therefore,
    the length  of the array is expected  to be same as  the maximum GID
    value defined  in the `maxp' table,  but there are  some fonts whose
    LookupTable format 0 is too  short to cover all GIDs.  FontValidator
    ignores  this error silently,  ftxvalidator and  ftxdumperfuser both
    warn and continue.  Similar problems are found in format 3 subtables
    of `kern'.  gxvalid  warns always and abort if  the validation level
    is set to FT_VALIDATE_PARANOID.

      5 fonts include too-short kern format 0 subtables.
      1 font includes too-short kern format 3 subtable.

  4-3. broken LookupTable format 2 (1/183)
  ----------------------------------------

    LookupTable  format  2,  subformat  4  covers the  GID  space  by  a
    collection  of  segments which  are  specified  by `firstGlyph'  and
    `lastGlyph'.   Some  fonts  store  `firstGlyph' and  `lastGlyph'  in
    reverse order,  so the segment specification is  broken.  Apple font
    tools ignore this error silently;  a broken segment is ignored as if
    it  did not  exist.   gxvalid  warns and  normalize  the segment  at
    FT_VALIDATE_DEFAULT, or ignore  the segment at FT_VALIDATE_TIGHT, or
    abort at FT_VALIDATE_PARANOID.

      1 font includes broken LookupTable format 2, in the `just' table.

    *) It seems  that all fonts manufactured by  ITC for AppleWorks have
       this error.

  4-4. bad bracketing in glyph property (14/183)
  ----------------------------------------------

    GX/AAT defines a  `bracketing' property of the glyphs  in the `prop'
    table,  to control layout  features of  strings enclosed  inside and
    outside  of   brackets.   Some  fonts   give  inappropriate  bracket
    properties  to glyphs.   Apple  font tools  warn  about this  error;
    gxvalid warns too and aborts at FT_VALIDATE_PARANOID.

      14 fonts include wrong bracket properties.


  4-5. invalid feature number (117/183)
  -------------------------------------

    The GX/AAT  extension can  include 255 different  layout features,
    but    popular    layout     features    are    predefined    (see
    https://developer.apple.com/fonts/TrueType-Reference-Manual/RM09/AppendixF.html).
    Some fonts include feature numbers which are incompatible with the
    predefined feature registry.

    In our survey, there are 140 fonts including `feat' table.

    a) 67 fonts use a feature number which should not be used.
    b) 117 fonts set the wrong feature range (nSetting).  This is mostly
       found in the `mort' and `morx' tables.

    Apple  font tools give  no warning,  although they  cannot recognize
    what  the feature  is.   At FT_VALIDATE_DEFAULT,  gxvalid warns  but
    continues in both cases (a, b).  At FT_VALIDATE_TIGHT, gxvalid warns
    and aborts for (a), but continues for (b).  At FT_VALIDATE_PARANOID,
    gxvalid warns and aborts in both cases (a, b).

  4-6. invalid prop version (10/183)
  ----------------------------------

    As most TrueType GX tables, the `prop' table must start with a 32bit
    version identifier: 0x00010000,  0x00020000 or 0x00030000.  But some
    fonts  store nonsense binary  data instead.   When Apple  font tools
    find them, they abort the processing immediately, and the data which
    follows is unhandled.  gxvalid does the same.

      10 fonts include broken `prop' version.

    All  of these  fonts are  classic  TrueType fonts  for the  Japanese
    script, manufactured by Apple.

  4-7. unknown resource name (2/183)
  ------------------------------------

    NOTE: THIS IS NOT A TRUETYPE GX ERROR.

    If  a TrueType  font is  stored  in the  resource fork  or in  dfont
    format, the data must be tagged as `sfnt' in the resource fork index
    to invoke TrueType font handler for the data.  But the TrueType font
    data  in   `Keyboard.dfont'  is  tagged   as  `kbd',  and   that  in
    `LastResort.dfont' is tagged as  `lst'.  Apple font tools can detect
    that the data is in  TrueType format and successfully validate them.
    Maybe  this is possible  because they  are known  to be  dfont.  The
    current  implementation  of the  resource  fork  driver of  FreeType
    cannot do that, thus gxvalid cannot validate them.

      2 fonts use an unknown tag for the TrueType font resource.

5. `kern' table issues
----------------------

  In common terminology of TrueType, `kern' is classified as a basic and
  platform-independent table.  But there are Apple extensions of `kern',
  and  there is  an  extension which  requires  a GX  state machine  for
  contextual kerning.   Therefore, gxvalid includes  a special validator
  for  `kern' tables.   Unfortunately, there  is no  exact  algorithm to
  check Apple's extension, so  gxvalid includes a heuristic algorithm to
  find  the proper validation  routines for  all possible  data formats,
  including    the   data    format   for    Microsoft.     By   calling
  classic_kern_validate() instead of gxv_validate(), you can specify the
  `kern' format  explicitly.  However, current  FreeType2 uses Microsoft
  `kern' format  only, others  are ignored (and  should be handled  in a
  library one level higher than FreeType).

  5-1. History
  ------------

    The original  16bit version of `kern'  was designed by  Apple in the
    pre-GX  era, and  it was  also approved  by  Microsoft.  Afterwards,
    Apple designed a  new 32bit version of the  `kern' table.  According
    to  the documentation, the  difference between  the 16bit  and 32bit
    version is only the size of  variables in the `kern' header.  In the
    following,  we call  the original  16bit version  as  `classic', and
    32bit version as `new'.

  5-2. Versions and dialects which should be differentiated
  ---------------------------------------------------------

    The `kern' table  consists of a table header  and several subtables.
    The version number  which identifies a `classic' or  a `new' version
    is  explicitly   written  in  the   table  header,  but   there  are
    undocumented  differences between  Microsoft's and  Apple's formats.
    It is  called a `dialect' in  the following.  There  are three cases
    which  should  be  handled:   the  new  Apple-dialect,  the  classic
    Apple-dialect,  and the classic  Microsoft-dialect.  An  analysis of
    the formats and the auto detection algorithm of gxvalid is described
    in the following.

    5-2-1. Version detection: classic and new kern
    ----------------------------------------------

      According  to Apple  TrueType  specification, there  are only  two
      differences between the classic and the new:

        - The `kern' table header starts with the version number.
          The classic version starts with 0x0000 (16bit),
          the new version starts with 0x00010000 (32bit).

        - In the  `kern' table header,  the number of  subtables follows
          the version number.
          In the classic version, it is stored as a 16bit value.
          In the new version, it is stored as a 32bit value.

      From Apple font tool's output (DumpKERN is also tested in addition
      to  the  three  Apple  font  tools in  above),  there  is  another
      undocumented difference.  In the  new version, the subtable header
      includes a 16bit variable  named `tupleIndex' which does not exist
      in the classic version.

      The new version  can store all subtable formats (0,  1, 2, and 3),
      but the Apple TrueType specification does not mention the subtable
      formats available in the classic version.

    5-2-2. Available subtable formats in classic version
    ----------------------------------------------------

      Although the  Apple TrueType  specification recommends to  use the
      classic version in  the case if the font is  designed for both the
      Apple and Microsoft platforms,  it does not document the available
      subtable formats in the classic version.

      According  to the Microsoft  TrueType specification,  the subtable
      format  assured for  Windows  and OS/2  support  is only  subtable
      format  0.  The  Microsoft TrueType  specification  also describes
      subtable format  2, but does  not mention which  platforms support
      it.  Subtable formats 1, 3,  and higher are documented as reserved
      for future use.  Therefore, the classic version can store subtable
      formats 0 and 2, at least.  `ttfdump.exe', a font tool provided by
      Microsoft,  ignores the  subtable format  written in  the subtable
      header, and parses the table as if all subtables are in format 0.

      `kern'  subtable format  1  uses  a StateTable,  so  it cannot  be
      utilized without a GX  State Machine.  Therefore, it is reasonable
      to assume  that format 1 (and  3) were introduced  after Apple had
      introduced GX and moved to the new 32bit version.

    5-2-3. Apple and Microsoft dialects
    -----------------------------------

      The  `kern' subtable  has  a 16bit  `coverage'  field to  describe
      kerning attributes, but bit interpretations by Apple and Microsoft
      are different:  For example, Apple  uses bits 0-7 to  identify the
      subtable, while Microsoft uses bits 8-15.

      In  addition, due  to the  output of  DumpKERN  and FontValidator,
      Apple's bit interpretations of coverage in classic and new version
      are  incompatible also.   In  summary, there  are three  dialects:
      classic Apple  dialect, classic  Microsoft dialect, and  new Apple
      dialect.  The classic Microsoft  dialect and the new Apple dialect
      are documented  by each vendors' TrueType  font specification, but
      the documentation for classic Apple dialect is not available.

      For example,  in the  new Apple dialect,  bit 15 is  documented as
      `set to  1 if  the kerning  is vertical'.  On  the other  hand, in
      classic Microsoft dialect, bit 1 is documented as `set to 1 if the
      kerning  is  horizontal'.   From   the  outputs  of  DumpKERN  and
      FontValidator, classic  Apple dialect recognizes  15 as `set  to 1
      when  the kerning  is horizontal'.   From the  results  of similar
      experiments, classic Apple dialect  seems to be the Endian reverse
      of the classic Microsoft dialect.

      As a  conclusion it must be  noted that no font  tool can identify
      classic Apple dialect or classic Microsoft dialect automatically.

    5-2-4. gxvalid auto dialect detection algorithm
    -----------------------------------------------

      The first 16  bits of the `kern' table are  enough to identify the
      version:

        - if  the first  16  bits are  0x0000,  the `kern'  table is  in
          classic Apple dialect or classic Microsoft dialect
        - if the first 16 bits are  0x0001, and next 16 bits are 0x0000,
          the kern table is in new Apple dialect.

      If the `kern'  table is a classic one,  the 16bit `coverage' field
      is checked next.   Firstly, the coverage bits are  decoded for the
      classic Apple dialect using the following bit masks (this is based
      on DumpKERN output):

        0x8000: 1=horizontal, 0=vertical
        0x4000: not used
        0x2000: 1=cross-stream, 0=normal
        0x1FF0: reserved
        0x000F: subtable format

      If  any  of  reserved  bits  are  set  or  the  subtable  bits  is
      interpreted as format 1 or 3, we take it as `impossible in classic
      Apple dialect' and retry, using the classic Microsoft dialect.

        The most popular coverage in new Apple-dialect:         0x8000,
        The most popular coverage in classic Apple-dialect:     0x0000,
        The most popular coverage in classic Microsoft dialect: 0x0001.

  5-3. Tested fonts
  -----------------

    We checked  59 fonts  bundled with MacOS  and 38 fonts  bundled with
    Windows, where all font include a `kern' table.

      - fonts bundled with MacOS
        * new Apple dialect
          format 0: 18
          format 2:  1
          format 3:  1
        * classic Apple dialect
          format 0: 14
        * classic Microsoft dialect
          format 0: 15

      - fonts bundled with Windows
        * classic Microsoft dialect
          format 0: 38

    It looks strange that classic Microsoft-dialect fonts are bundled to
    MacOS: they come from MSIE for MacOS, except of MarkerFelt.dfont.

IJS 0.35

News as of 0.35:
11 Feb 2004

The autoconf build system has been moderized and we now use 
libtool for portable shared library building. Thanks to Roger
Leigh for helping with that.

Also a bug with ColorSpace field was corrected, thanks to David 
Suffield.

News as of 0.34:
22 Apr 2002

The source files now have official MIT license banners. Thanks to
www.opensource.org for hosting the ur-text of this license. Also
some clarifications on namespace management in the spec.

There is now an IJS website, graciously hosted by linuxprinting.org.
http://www.linuxprinting.org/ijs/

There have been some minor improvements in the makefile.

News as of 0.33:

The buffer size has been increased to 4096. It should probably be
dynamically allocated, though. Minor clarification in BitsPerSample
language in spec (thanks to Jackie Chang for pointing out the
ambiguity).

News as of 0.32:

The xres and yres fields of ph are now floats.

The example server now supports margins. A few small bugs have
been cleaned up as well.

News as of 0.31:

A number of small cleanups in the code. The example client and server
support more querying and enumeration, but not yet margins.

There is a new API for the client to query the negotiated version
number.

The ijs_exec_unix module now sets the SIGPIPE signal to ignore. This
way, if the client abnormally exits, it allows the error to propagate
through the read() or write() call to the pipe, rather than
immediately killing the client.

News as of 0.30:

It now builds as a library. Also, there is basic autoconf support (but
not automake or libtool). It's probably best to link the static
library for now. I'm open to suggestions - I'm open to drinking the
entire pitcher of auto* Kool-Aid, but we probably won't use libtool
in Ghostscript builds.

This release fixes a number of bugs and improves portability. In
particular, server errors should now bubble up to the client, and
the termination logic has been patched according to David Suffield,
who discovered a race condition there. Thanks to David and Russell
for patches.

The spec is now in a reasonable draft. See ijs_spec.sgml and
ijs_spec.pdf. Comments and suggestions are welcome.

The example client and server have _not_ yet been updated to use
the newer features of the ijs spec. Patches are welcome.

News as of 0.29:

I've added a number of things discussed on the mailing list, including
listing and enumerating parameters, as well as a job abstraction.
The client interface has changed a bit - job id's are now present
in most callbacks, colorspace is now presented only as a string, and
there are quite a few more callbacks.

I've started a skeleton of a protocol spec in DocBook.

Note, there's a potential race condition in EXIT noted by David
Suffield. The fix hasn't yet been merged in from his work.

News as of 0.2:

This version integrates set_param and get_param, and has moved the
"page header" processing to use set_param.

Also, there are both Windows (MS VC++) and Unix makefiles. Use
"make -f unix.mak" to build on Unix. Thanks to Russell Lang for
Windows portability work.


Introduction

This is an early snapshot of IJS. I expect the protocols and API's to
evolve somewhat, and things like error handling are still far from
perfect. However, I'm pretty happy that this is going in the right
direction.

I am doing this prerelease so that authors of various packages related
to raster-based printing can start thinking about how to integrate it.
Ideally, all producers of printable raster data should be able to
function as an ijs client, and all consumers should be able to
function as an ijs server. This release is about as functional as
piping pnm's, which is primitive, but the way a lot of drivers still
work.


What is IJS?

IJS is, first and foremost, a protocol for transmission of raster page
images. This snapshot provides a reference implementation of the
protocol, the design of which is still in flux. When the protocol
specification is published, it will be authoritative. Applications
should feel free to link against the library provided in this package,
adapt that code for their own needs, or roll a completely new
implementation.

The protocol is a fairly traditional client-server design. In general,
the client sends one or more page images to the server, along with
various metadata. Communication is through simple "commands", which
are essentially size-prefixed packets. The client sends a command to
the server, then waits for a response command, either ACK or NAK.

The server "speaks" IJS through stdin and stdout. One consequence of
this design decision is that the server can be invoked remotely, for
example through ssh. It's not clear yet how useful this will be, but
at least people can experiment with it.

Currently, all data goes through the stdin and stdout pipes. It is
envisioned that a shared memory transport will also be provided,
transparently. IJS will fall back to pipes if shared memory is not
available for any reason.

I'm not yet convinced that the performance win for shared memory is
significant. I would like to benchmark domain sockets as well, as they
are likely to provide better performance than pipes, and are also
highly desirable for cases where the server runs as a persistent
daemon.

This tarball provides an "IJS library" in the form of ijs, ijs_client,
and ijs_server. It also provides an example client (capable of reading
pnmraw files) and an example server (capable of generating
PostScript). I imagine that the example programs will be useful for
development and testing, but that end-users probably won't find a need
for them.

To try IJS, compile and run "./ijs_client_example -s
./ijs_server_example -pOutputFile=/tmp/tmp.ps foo.ppm". This will
invoke ./ijs_server_example, which will in turn generate a /tmp/tmp.ps
file.

The ijs_client_example takes a -p command line argument for setting
parameters, and a -r argument for setting resolution.  Here is a
typical command line:

./ijs_client_example -s ./ijs_server_example -pOutputFile=/tmp/tmp.ps \
  -r300 in.ppm

The syntax of -p is a sequence of key=value pairs, separated by
commas.  A backslash in the value escapes the next character (allowing
embedded commas in the value). Thus, '-pfoo=bar, quux=a\,b' sets the
key "foo" to the value "bar, and the key "quux" to the value "a,b".


FAQ

What does IJS stand for?

It stands for "raster printer driver architecture." It's spelled
U+30EA U+13DA, to avoid confusion, and to save space in UTF-16
encodings.

Actually, the name derives from HPIJS, which presumably stands for HP
InkJet Server. The name pays homage to HPIJS for the inspiration,
while communicating that it's not specific to HP printers.

Licensing

All source code in this distribution is released under the MIT
License. I want everybody to be able to use this.


More stuff to write:

Actual specification for the protocol (in draft).

Client spawns server, invoker invokes client and server, and
persistent server daemon modes.

Negotation of extensions (goal is interoperability between versions).
(Actually, the PING/PONG protocol as it exists negotiates version
numbers).

TODO:

Shared memory transport.

Should have an alternate mode in which the client is passed the pipe
information, rather than having to spawn the server.

wait() cleanup of invoked server.

Package library up as libijs.a, .so (partially done)

## About

This package contains an **OCR engine** - `libtesseract` and a **command line program** - `tesseract`.

Tesseract 4 adds a new neural net (LSTM) based [OCR engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) which is focused on line recognition, but also still supports the legacy Tesseract OCR engine of Tesseract 3 which works by recognizing character patterns. Compatibility with Tesseract 3 is enabled by using the Legacy OCR Engine mode (--oem 0).
It also needs [traineddata](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Data-Files.html) files which support the legacy engine, for example those from the [tessdata](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata) repository.

Stefan Weil is the current lead developer. Ray Smith was the lead developer until 2018. The maintainer is Zdenko Podobny. For a list of contributors see [AUTHORS](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/main/AUTHORS)
and GitHub's log of [contributors](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/graphs/contributors).

Tesseract has **unicode (UTF-8) support**, and can **recognize [more than 100 languages](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Data-Files-in-different-versions.html)** "out of the box".

Tesseract supports **[various image formats](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/InputFormats)** including PNG, JPEG and TIFF.

Tesseract supports **various output formats**: plain text, hOCR (HTML), PDF, invisible-text-only PDF, TSV and ALTO.

You should note that in many cases, in order to get better OCR results, you'll need to **[improve the quality](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/ImproveQuality.html) of the image** you are giving Tesseract.

This project **does not include a GUI application**. If you need one, please see the [3rdParty](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/User-Projects-%E2%80%93-3rdParty.html) documentation.

Tesseract **can be trained to recognize other languages**.
See [Tesseract Training](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Training-Tesseract.html) for more information.

## Brief history

Tesseract was originally developed at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories Bristol UK and at Hewlett-Packard Co, Greeley Colorado USA between 1985 and 1994, with some more changes made in 1996 to port to Windows, and some C++izing in 1998. In 2005 Tesseract was open sourced by HP. From 2006 until November 2018 it was developed by Google.

Major version 5 is the current stable version and started with release
[5.0.0](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/releases/tag/5.0.0) on November 30, 2021. Newer minor versions and bugfix versions are available from
[GitHub](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/releases/).

Latest source code is available from [main branch on GitHub](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/tree/main).

This is a windows application for creating ICC profiles.  It has multiple uses 
described below.

The Device N profiles controls can be used to accurately define
color for PDF and PS DeviceN color spaces.  To use this tool, you will need 
to have CIELAB measurements of M^N equally spaced in device values from min 
to max inkoverprinted spot colors (or spot and process colors).  See the example 
folder for sample input when we have N=2 colors with M=6 samples.  You will also 
need a file that has the  names of the colorants as they are used for the 
DeviceN color space in the document.  The order of the names must be related to 
the rate of change of the CIELAB data in the hypercube of measurements.  The 
first name relates to the device value that changes more slowly in the CIELAB 
data, while the last name relates to the device value that changes more rapidly 
in the CIELAB data.  To include the DeviceN ICC profiles in ghostscript when 
processing a PDF or PS file that includes those spaces, use 
-sDeviceNProfile="5channel.icc; 6channel.icc; duotone.icc". 

The Thresholding Profiles controls allow one to generate ICC profiles that will 
threshold  the output value for the device gray profile.  The threshold range is 
based upon L*.  Values with an L* above the threshold value will map to white 
those below will map to black.

Default Profile Generation is used to create ICC profiles that can emulate the 
old PS color mapping routines.  The mapping to CMYK requires the specification
of a particular undercolor and black generation mappings (UCR/BG).  The data is 
specified by the user in a table of tab delimited values.  The range of values
is 0 to 255 and example sets of data are given in the files ucr_bg_no_k.txt and
ucr_bg_max_k.  The CMYK ICC profiles generated from these data are given in
no_k.icc and max_k.icc.  The max_k.icc profile may be useful in generating black
only text output from neutral source data. This is achieved using ghostscript with
the option -sTextICCProfile=max_k.icc (where max_k.icc is included in ./iccprofiles
and ghostscript is built with the ROM file system).

Release notes ETS version 150
8 May 2014
Copyright 2000-2014 Artifex Sotware Inc.

This release removed the SSE and VEC code so that we could focus on 
repairing lingering issues with the C code. 

Robin fixed issues in the actual ETS code.  In particular he fixed issues with 
the "white count test" and the FS weights.  We did a fair amount of testing 
with the various parameters. We also added more useful image outputs in the test 
bed allowing the creation of multiple colorants in PSD format including 16bit.
We also moved to a Visual Studio solution for the project.

Release notes ETS version 138
26 Apr 2006
Copyright 2000-2010 Artifex Sotware Inc.
 
This is the latest unified release of Even Tone Screening. The core
ETS algorithm has been highly tuned for modern inkjet printers such as
the latest EPSON seven color devices. In addition, there are alternate
versions of the core screening algorithm written for both Altivec
(G4/PPC 970) and SSE2 (Pentium 4) instruction sets. The quality of the
results with assembly speedup is comparable, but will not be
bit-identical to the C code.


README for Even Better Screening

EBS is the newest refinement of Even Toned Screening. It is based on
the same fundamental algorithms as ETS, and adds several interesting
features.

1. It's possible to screen all planes in tandem, rather than screening
each plane independent. The result is a more even distribution of
inks, and an avoidance of "interference patterns" between similar fine
structure in the planes.

2. The number of levels of output is adjustable at runtime. Most
modern inkjets support multiple drop sizes, and the number of discrete
drop sizes seems to be increasing.

3. Dot aspect ratios of 1:1, 2:1, and 4:1 are directly supported.

4. An option exists to apply Even Toned smoothing to shadow dots as
well as highlight dots. In print modes where individual white dots
in the shadow areas are visible, this avoids wormy patterns. It is
a runtime option because there is a speed penalty. [ Note: this
option not fully supported in the current release ]

5. More parameters are tunable at runtime, including the amplitude of
added random noise, and the scale for the Even Toned output dependent
feedback signal.

Some usage tips:

The default parameters for even_c1_scale, rand_scale, and do_shadows
are all 0, and should give good results. The reasonable range for
rand_scale is about -4 .. 3. Higher values result in more randomness.
The effects should be quite easy to see. even_c1_scale produces a more
subtle effect. Values of -1 or -2 should produce slightly less regular
patterns in highlights. This might be a good idea on printers with
poor accuracy between passes, for example in bidirectional modes.
As mentioned above, set do_shadows to 1 if wormy patterns are visible
in shadows. At high resolutions on most inkjet printers, the dots are
so close together that individual white pixels cannot be seen.

The planes in the call to even_better_line() should be sorted in
darkest-to-lightest order, for example K, C, M, c, m, Y. The
strengths[] parameter should be an array of approximate darkness
values for the inks, for example { 128, 50, 50, 25, 25, 10 }. It
might be worth fiddling with the strength parameters.


Compiling SSE2

To enable SSE2 in evenbetter-rll.c, enable the #define USE_AVEC
conditional compile.

The SSE2 optimized code is in the assembly language file eb_sse2.s.
In addition, I've included two win32-format object files, with and
without the leading underscore. I believe the former is the one to use
for both MS and Watcom compilers.

You can use the NASM tool to reassemble the eb_sse2.s file. Use the
following command line:

nasm eb_sse2.s -f win32

Most compilers will need an additional underscore prefix in front of
the global symbols. There's an _eb_sse2.s file that's the same as
eb_sse2.s except for this change, and it can be assembled using the
same command line as above, just with _eb_sse2.s as the filename.

The included Makefile_sse2 will compile the test_evenbetter executable
on Linux platforms. This utility acts as a pipe and converts pgm to
pgm.


Release notes for 2003-10-21 Altivec-optimized EvenBetter code drop

1. Compiling

To enable Altivec in evenbetter-rll.c, enable the #define USE_AVEC
conditional compile.

The Altivec optimized code is in the C-language file eb_avec.c, using
the Altivec intrinsics. Most up-to-date compilers should have support
for this. With GCC, use the following command line:

gcc -faltivec -O2 -Wall -Wmissing-prototypes   -c -o eb_avec.o eb_avec.c

Note that the -O3 option was tested and did not succeed, at least on
GCC 3.3, build 1435.

On other compilers, it may be necessary to define the HAVE_ALTIVEC_H
preprocessor macro.

The included Makefile_avec will compile the test_evenbetter executable
on OS X platforms. This utility acts as a pipe and converts pgm to
pgm.

2. Code changes

For the most part, this code uses the same API as before. However,
there is one important change: destination buffers _must_ be aligned
to 16-byte boundaries, and should also have an additional 16 bytes of
padding at the end.

I've provided eb_malloc_aligned() and eb_free_aligned() as handy
utility functions for allocating aligned memory blocks. See the
allocation of "obuf" in the sample code (test_evenbetter.c) for an
example.

3. Performance and quality

Barring bugs, quality should be almost identical to the scalar
version.

I did not implement the test for G4 capability, as it's fairly
dependent on platform specifics. Currently, G4 is always assumed,
so the code is likely to crash when run on G3's. To fix this,
edit the line "using_vectors = 1;" so that vectors are only enabled
when the G4/G5 is detected. See:

http://developer.apple.com/hardware/ve/g3_compatibility.html

Performance is most optimal when the number of planes is a multiple of
4. Screening 5 planes will take about the same time as screening 8.


Tone-dependent randomness scaling

As of version 134, ETS can accept lookup tables to control the tone-
dependent randomness scaling. If you do not wish to use this feature,
you must set the new rand_scale_luts field of EvenBetterParams to
NULL.

Otherwise, rand_scale_luts has the same layout as luts - an array of
pointers, one for each plane, to int arrays of size ET_SRC_MAX + 1.
Each value of the array corresponds to one input tone level; in general,
if you change the luts, you'll want to change the rand_scale_luts
accordingly.

The nominal value is 65536, which is a fairly small level of
randomness.  In general, gray values near round rational numbers (1/2,
1/3, etc.) will need higher levels of randomness in order to avoid
repeating patterns. The current default, as computed in
eb_compute_randshift, peaks at 2 << 19 for 1/4 and 1/2, 2 << 18 for
1/3, and 2 << 17 for 1/6 and 1/9.

Note also that even when using the rand_scale_luts, the rand_scale
parameter still has the effect of globally scaling the randomness
value. Each increment by one of rand_scale is equivalent to doubling
the values in the rand_scale luts. simultaneously doubling the
rand_scale_lut values and decreasing rand_scale by 1 has no effect.

To really fine-tune the tone-dependent randomness for a device, we
recommend running grayscale test files with several different
constant values for the luts, then visually choosing the best value
for each grayscale value in the test file. Different devices will be
sensitive to different patterns, depending on the details of the
weaving.

Lastly, keep in mind that the randomness scaling is quantized to
powers of two in the scalar code, but is smoothly variable in the
vector versions.


Notes on per-channel even_c1_scale settings

As of version 135, this code supports per-channel setting of
even_c1_scale, as a way to control artifacts in "dirty highlights".
Recommended values are -2 for full-strength inks for which light
variants exist (magenta, cyan, and black on EPSON 7-color printer),
and 0 for all other inks.


Notes on mseveneighths

The eb_avec vector version contains an experimental workaround for
problems in "dirty highlights". It is disabled by default, but can
easily be enabled by uncommenting these two lines in eb_avec.c:

	//	f_4 = vec_abs(f_3);
	//	f_3 = vec_madd(f_4, mseveneighths, f_3);

The values in mseveneighths in eb_avec.c can also be adjusted -
while the current value is -.875, values of -.90 or -.95 may be
more effective in controlling the dirty highlights problem. However,
values too near -1 seem to create other artifacts.

Pending feedback from users, this experimental feature will either
be removed from all versions, or added to all versions.


Partial version history

Version 138 contains a fix to eb_malloc_aligned for crashes when the
base allocator is aligned to 4-byte but not 8-byte boundaries. Also,
the .obj files for eb_sse2.s are updated, while in some 137 tarballs
they were stale.

Version 137 mostly contains small changes to the vector code to make
it more like the scalar version.

[There was never a consistent 136 release, although some code did go
out with that version number]

Version 135 adds per-channel control of even_c1_scale.

Version 134 has tone-dependent randomness scaling.

Version 133 has some fixes to make the code compile in C++.

Version 132 fixes some improperly merged files in the 131 release.

Version 131 contains a fix for a subtle problem in the noisy highlight
change in 130, as well as more robust support for > 8bpp deep images
on vector platforms.

Version 130 contains a quality improvement in noisy highlight regions.

Version 129 contains performance tuning for the SSE2 implementation.

Version 128 contains a significant speedup in the prep (Altivec only),
specialized to 8-but LUT's with gamma 1.0, 1.8, or 2.0. There is a new
"gamma" parameter to enable it - a value of 0.0 uses the old LUT-based
code.

In addition, make sure the input buffer is allocated with 16-byte
alignment, and is also padded up to a size which is a multiple of 16
bytes.

This version also unifies the SSE2 release. To enable, undefine
USE_AVEC and define USE_SSE2 at the top of evenbetter-rll.c.

Ordered Dither Screen Creation Tool. Copyright 2010-2021 Artifex Software, Inc.

This code is designed to enable the creation of clustered dot threshold arrays
for halftoning, which can provide high lpi without quantization issues.  As
the lpi requirements of a halftone screen increases and begins to approach the
limits of the printer resolution, the size of the clustered dot decreases and
the number of levels that can be represented by the clustered dot decreases. 
To overcome this, the clustered dots are placed in a larger threshold array,
where the threshold values of the individual clustered dots scaled are
dithered to enable the representation of more gray levels within the larger
screen.  The dithering is performed in a manner that is pleasing to the visual
system.

The command line and parameters are as follows:

gen_ordered [-a target_angle] -d [dot_shape] -f [ps | ppm | raw | raw16 | tos]
    [-l target_lpi] [-q target_quantization_levels] [-r resolution]
    [-s size_of_supercell] 

where:

target_angle: The desired screen angle in degrees. [default 0 degrees]

dot_shape: The index number of the dot shape, CIRCLE, REDBOOK_CIRCLE, INVERTED,
    RHOMBOID, LINE_X, LINE_Y, DIAMOND1, DIAMOND2 or ROUNDSPOT values from 0 to 8,
    respectively.

target_lpi: The desired resolution of the screen in lines/inch. [default 300dpi]

target_quantization_levels:  indicates the desired number of "gray" levels
    that you wish to achieve with the screen (e.g. 256). [default 256]
    Special note on this option.  To achieve a particular quantization
    level, it is neccessary that the size_of_supercell is sufficiently large.
    Since the default size of size_of_supercell is set to 1, the minimum
    possible size is always used and the target quantization may not be 
    achieved.  A warning is displayed to indicate this condition and a minimum
    size is suggested.

resolution: The resolution of the output device in dots/inch. Horizontal and
    vertical resolution can be different if given as -rHxV where H is the
    horizontal, and V is the vertical resolution.  [default 300dpi]

size_of_supercell: The specified size of the supercell will impact the number
    of achievable levels.  If a small size is specified (example 1) the
    smallest periodic cell will be created, regardless of the setting for
    target_quantization_levels and it is possible that target_quantization_levels
    will not be achieved.  size_of_supercell should be set to something
    reasonably large to achieve a specified target_quantization_levels, for
    example 64.  Work is underway to have this value optimally set based upon
    the desired number of gray levels.

The output format (-f format) [default: tos] can be one of:

Portable Pixmap (ppm): The screen is stored in a .ppm image that is readily
    viewed by most image viewers. A maximum of 256 levels can be written in the
    format.  

PostScript (ps): The output will be a screen that can readily be brought into
    ghostscript.  For example:

    gswin32c -r300 -dDisplayFormat=16#20102 -c \
        "(Screen_20x10.ps) run sethalftone" examples/tiger.eps

    This will be a HalftoneType 3, 8-bit threshold array unless there are more
    than 256 levels. For up to 65,536 levels a HalftoneType 16 Postscript
    threshold array will be output.

Raw (raw): An 8 bit row ordered Width x Height threshold array that is
    periodic vertically and horizontally.  The size of the array is indicated in
    the output file name, for example Screen_Dithered_WxH.raw. A maximum of 256
    levels can be written in this format.  

16-bitRaw (raw16): An 16 bit row ordered Width x Height threshold array that
    is periodic vertically and horizontally.  The size of the array is indicated
    in the output file name, for example Screen_Dithered_WxH.16.raw. A maximum of
    65536 levels can be written in this format.  

Turn-On-Sequence (tos): A format compatible with the 'thresh_remap' program.
    This consists of a line with the Width and Height of the threshold array as
    "# W=%d H=%d\n" followed by (width * height) x, y pairs in the format "%d\t%d
    n". This format can support more than 65,536 levels, and is the default format.

Currently the code is limited in a few features, which will be included in the
near future:

1) The code currently only creates bi-level threshold arrays.  It is planned
   to enable the creation of multi-level threshold arrays.  Due to the manner
   in which the screens are created, this should be a simple task.

2) Often it is desired to incorporate a tone reproduction curve (TRC) into the
   design of a screen.  While not currently supported, the plan is add that
   option into this code. The thresh_remap program can be used to incorporate
   a TRC from the 'tos' format.

3) Typically screens are designed off line and provided as a threshold array
   to most applications.  In postscript, it is possible that screens can be
   specified within the document with specific attributes including line
   frequency and dot shape.  This code needs significant optimization before
   it should be folded into the ghostscript code base for use in this manner.

4) Minimum dot size handling is also a feature to be added.

The following is used to transform a named color value at a particular tint
value to the output device values.  This function is provided only as a
demonstration and will likely need to be altered and optimized for those wishing
to perform full spot color look-up support.

The object used to perform the transformation is typically
a look-up table that contains the spot color name and a CIELAB value for
100% colorant (it could also contain device values in the table).
It can be more complex where-by you have a 1-D lut that
provides CIELAB values or direct device values as a function of tint.  In
such a case, the table would be interpolated to compute all possible tint values.
If CIELAB values are provided, they can be pushed through the
device profile using the CMM.  In this particular demonstration, we simply
provide CIELAB for a few color names in the file
toolbin/color/named_color/named_color_table.txt .
The tint value is used to scale the CIELAB value from 100% colorant to a D50
whitepoint.  The resulting CIELAB value is then pushed through the CMM to
obtain device values for the current device.  The file named_colors.pdf
which is in toolbin/color/named_color/ contains these
spot colors and will enable the user to see how the code behaves.  The named
color table is specified to ghostscript by the command line option
-sNamedProfile=./toolbin/color/named_color/named_color_table.txt (or with
full path name).  If it is desired to have ghostscript compiled with the
named color table, it can be placed in the iccprofiles directory and then
build ghostscript with COMPILE_INITS=1.  When specified the file contents
are pointed to by the buffer member variable of the device_named profile in
profile manager.  When the first call occurs in here, the contents of the
buffer are parsed and placed into a custom stucture that is pointed to by
the profile pointer.  Note that this pointer is not visible to the garbage
collector and should be allocated in non-gc memory as is demonstrated in
this sample.  The structure elements are released when the profile is
destroyed through the call to gsicc_named_profile_release, which is set
as the value of the profile member variable release.

Note that there are calls defined in gsicc_littlecms.c that will create link
transforms between Named Color ICC profiles and the output device.  Such
profiles are rarely used (at least I have not run across any yet) so the
code is currently not used.  Also note that for those serious about named
color support, a cache as well as efficient table-look-up methods would
likely be important for performance.

Finally note that PANTONE is a registered trademark and PANTONE colors are a
licensed product of XRITE Inc. See http://www.pantone.com
for more information.  Licensees of Pantone color libraries or similar
libraries should find it straight forward to interface.  Pantone names are
referred to in named_color_table.txt and contained in the file named_colors.pdf.

!!!!IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO PERFORM THE PROPER DEALLOCATION
    CLEAN-UP OF THE STRUCTURES WHEN rc_free_icc_profile OCCURS FOR THE NAMED
    COLOR PROFILE!!!!!!   See gsicc_named_profile_release below for an example.
    This is set in the profile release member variable.

   This is the code that is used to convert the various PDF and PS CIE
   based color spaces to ICC profiles.  This enables the use of an
   external CMS that is ICC centric to be used for ALL color management.

   The following spaces are handled:

   From PDF

   % Input Spaces

   CalRGB      -->  ICC 1-D LUTS and Matrix
   CalGray     -->  ICC 1-D LUT
   LAB         -->  ICC MLUT with a 2x2 sized table

   From PS

   %% Input Spaces

   CIEBasedABC  --> ICC 1-D LUTs and Matrix
   CIEBasedA    --> ICC 1-D LUT
   CIEBasedDEF  --> 3-D MLUT plus 1-D LUTs
   CIEBasedDEFG --> 4-D MLUT pluse 1-D LUTs

   %% Output Spaces

   Type1 CRD -->  ICC will have MLUT if render table present.

   A few notes:

   Required Tags for ALL profiles include:

       profileDescriptionTag
       copyrightTag
       mediaWhatePointTag
       chromaticAdaptationTag (V4 -  when measurement data is for other than D50)

   For color input profiles:

       Required if N-component LUT-based:

          AToB0Tag   (NOTE ONE WAY! BtoA0Tag is optional. Not true for
                          display profiles.)

       Required if 3 component matrix based:

           redMatrixColumnTag
           greenMatrixColumnTag
           blueMatrixColumnTag
           redTRCTag
           greenTRCTag
           blueTRCTag

       Notes:

       3-component can include AToB0Tag.
       Only CIEXYZ encoding can be used with matrix/TRC models.
       If CIELAB encoding is to be used, we must use LUT-based.

    For Monochrome input:

       Required:
           grayTRCTag

       Optional
           AToB0Tag

    For Color Display Profiles:

PANTONE colors to the Ghostscript graphics library.  PANTONE colors
are specified in both PostScript and PDF files via the use of DeviceN
or Separation color spaces.

licensed product of Pantone Inc. See http://www.pantone.com
for more information.

See the comments at the start of src/gsnamecl.c for description of the
client color processing routines.

Since this is only a 'demo' implementation, the example implementation does
not have some features which might be expected in a 'real' implementation.

1.  The Pantone color data table does not have actual entries for all
    of the different Pantone colors.  This data is not included since
    the values are dependent upon specific details of the output device,
    inks, etc.
2.  Colors in PostScript and PDF are specified with by values between
    0 and 1.  The output colorant values are scaled linearly.
3.  DeviceN color spaces can specify multiple colors.  However this
    implementation assumes that if a PANTONE color is specified in a
    DeviceN color space, then only PANTONE colors or CMYK are present.
    This was done to keep the code simple.  If other colors are present,
    then this implementation falls back to using the alternate color space
    specified with the DeviceN color space.  (This is the normal PS
    and PDF operation.)

See also src/zsncdummy.c for an example custom color callback.

One way we can arrive here is from gs_copy_font() -> z42_font_info(), in
that case we definitely want to copy the copyright informatoin if there is any,
but we don't want to throw an error if we find a Type 42 font which has no
copyright information. So get the informaton, but ignore the return code.

This file is used to rename automatically all internal engine
functions, when the macro 'TT_PREFIX_ALL_NAMES' is defined.

This is useful to avoid conflicts at link time between functions
from different sources but with the same name.  As a convention,
all FreeType internal functions names are prefixed with the two
letters "FT" by this file.

Note that this file doesn't change the names of FreeType's
external functions, which all begin with "TT_". These are:

- the High-Level API functions (defined in "freetype.h")
- the portable components (memory, file and mutex)

TODO:

- Fix the non-square pixel case (or how to manage the CVT to
  detect horizontal and vertical scaled FUnits ?)


Changes between 2.3 and 2.2:

- added support for rotation, stretching, instruction control

- added support for non-square pixels.  However, this doesn't
  work perfectly yet...

Changes between 2.2 and 2.1:

- a small bugfix in the Push opcodes

Changes between 2.1 and 2.0:

- created the TTExec component to take care of all execution
  context management.  The interpreter has now one single
  function.

- made some changes to support re-entrancy.  The re-entrant
  interpreter is smaller!

contrib/gdevhl12.c

This driver handles the 1200x600 dpi mode, and some settings like
paper source and toner save mode.  600x600 dpi and below is handled
by gdevdljm.c (basically as in the ljet4 device, with minor changes
in initialization and margins, and PCL wrapped in PJL).

There are two device names made available by this driver, which
differ only in the default (maximum) resolution:

  -sDEVICE=hl1240
     600x600 dpi, for HL-1030/1240 (uses standard PCL modes 2 and 3)

  -sDEVICE=hl1250
     1200x600 dpi, for HL-1050/1070/1250/1270N
     (uses special compression mode 1027 for 1200x600 dpi,
     otherwise modes 2 and 3 as above)

Tested with a HL-1250, both 1200x600 and 600x600 dpi.  Please test
with other models and report results (both problems and success).
Some notes on the other models:

  HL-1070 and HL-1270N
     can also print Postscript directly, at maximum 600x600 dpi
     (this driver can print 1200x600 dpi using mode 1027).

  HL-1240
     should no longer be limited to 300 dpi - this driver sends
     the recommended "@PJL SET RESOLUTION=..." command.  PLEASE TEST.
     There have been some vague problem reports (wrong margins? not
     clear for what paper size, quite possibly Letter, not A4?) with
     this printer, if you have it and some Ghostscript hacking skills,
     _please_ try to help, fix it and send me a patch - thanks!

  HL-1030
     should no longer be "Paperweight" despite the "for Windows only"
     warning :-) - it knows enough PCL to print raster graphics, but
     *requires* "@PJL ENTER LANGUAGE=PCL", so it does not work with
     the ljet4 driver sending raw PCL.  The windows driver uses an
     undocumented compression mode 1030, but modes 2 and 3 work too.
     PLEASE TEST.

New models, still need to be tested:
  HL-1230 (GDI printer)
  HL-1440 (GDI printer)
  HL-1450 (PCL6 and PS2 emulation)
  HL-1470N (PCL6 and PS2 emulation)

Additional settings (gs command line options) for this driver:

  -dEconoMode=0...2
     toner save mode: 0 = disabled (default), 1 = 25%, 2 = 50%

  -dPaperType=0...4
     paper type: 0 = plain (default), 1 = thin, 2 = thick, 3 = thicker,
     4 = transparency

  -dSourceTray=0...4
     paper source: 0 = auto (default), 1 = dual, 2 = upper, 3 = lower,
     4 = manual (not all models support the optional lower tray)

The 1200x600 dpi mode may require a lot of printer memory - the manual
recommends at least 10 MB; for me it seems to work well with 8 MB: 4 MB
standard + 4 MB "finally found some good use for that old PS/2 SIMM" :-).
Even at just 600x600 dpi (normal PCL 5 control codes) print quality is
very good, at 1200x600 dpi it is difficult to see the difference (more
visible on grayscale images).  So 600x600 dpi is best for general use.

The HL-1250 also supports PCL 6 (PCL XL) but
- I don't have the documentation for that
- the pxlmono driver works, but the output looks a bit different
  from that generated by the ljet4 or (this) 1200x600 dpi driver
  (lines appear very thin - not yet sure if this is a driver bug
  or differences in PCL 6 implementation, someone should check on
  a HP printer, does tiger.ps printed using the ljet4 and pxlmono
  drivers, both at 600x600 dpi, look the same?)
so let's use the good old ljet4 (PCL 5) driver for now.
(PCL 6 seems to offer better compression though.)

To do: the undocumented mode 1030 may offer better compression
(may help print complex graphics at 600 dpi - the HL-1030/1240 have
only 2 MB of non-expandable RAM, which may not be enough for data
that doesn't compress well).  The windows driver uses this mode for
all models, not just HL-1030.  Documentation may be available later.

Many thanks to Richard Thomas <richardt@brother.co.uk> for help
(sending me a HL-1250, documentation, answering my questions).

Thanks to L. Peter Deutsch <ghost@aladdin.com> for making gdevdjet.c
and gdevdljm.[ch] available under a dual AFPL/GPL license.

Operation: The page bitmap is scanned to determined the
actual margins.  A "graphics rectangle" is defined to
contain the included data and positioned on the page.
The bitmap is then re-read and "sixellized" by converting
each three bytes to four six-bit chunks (zero padding on
the right if necessary) and adding x'3F' to generate a
printable code.  Runs of up to 32767 identical characters
are compressed to an ascii count and a single character.

    EPRN_TRAILING_BIT_BUG_FIXED
        Define this to deactivate compensation for a bug in ghostscript which
        leads to the last pixel in an RGB line being black instead of white.
        This occurs at least in gs 6.01 and 6.50. The correction covers only
        the one-bit-per-colorant case and is equivalent to clipping the pixel.

*******************************************************************************

  The eprn device uses 'gx_color_index' values with varying interpretations,
  depending on the colour model and the rendering method, and stores them at
  different pixmaps depths, normally using the smallest depth which can
  accommodate all colorants at the same number of bits per colorant.

  To simplify matters, a field for the black component is always included, even
  for RGB and CMY, i.e., there are either 1 or 4 bit fields in a
  'gx_color_index' value. If there are 4, the interpretation is either YMCK or
  BGRK, looking from left to right (most to least significant). The width of
  the fields can be found in the 'bits_per_colorant' variable in the eprn part
  of the device instance.

  Within each colorant field, not all bits need be used. Except when using the
  *_max() colour mapping functions, the values returned by
  eprn_bits_for_levels() for the parameters 'black_levels' and
  'non_black_levels' determine the number of bits which are actually
  meaningful. Only the last (least significant) bits are used.

  The 'eprn' device
  *****************
  In developing my hpdj/pcl3 driver for PCL 3+ I had to implement a lot of
  functionality which was logically independent of PCL. This indicated that the
  functionality offered by ghostscript's 'prn' device was insufficient and
  should be extended, leading to this "extended prn device".

  Functionality
  =============
  The "eprn" device offers the following services to derived devices:
  - A simple but still flexible rendering model. A derived device defines
    printer capability descriptions listing the supported rendering parameters,
    lets the eprn device handle the user's rendering requests, and then just
    fetches the pixels.
  - A PostScript-conforming initialization of default user space with respect
    to landscape orientation and support for the standard page device parameter
    "LeadingEdge".
  - Recognition of media sizes from the document and checking of supported
    sizes based on printer descriptions
  - Flexible handling of size-specific hardware margins
  - Counting of pages printed across gs invocations by means of page count
    files

  Rendering Model
  ===============
  The "eprn" device parameterizes the printer's rendering capabilities as
  follows:
  - process colour model (Gray, RGB, CMY, CMY+K, CMYK)
  - resolution in horizontal and vertical directions
  - number of intensity levels per colorant, chosen independently for black
    and non-black (RGB or CMY) colorants.
  In addition, the rendering process as implemented in this driver is
  parameterized by:
  - method for rendering intensities (printer, halftones or error diffusion)
  These parameters are specified by the user. The device checks whether the
  printer supports the requested combination and, if it does, sets
  ghostscript's internal data structures accordingly.

  The derived device can obtain the resulting pixels by successively calling
  eprn_get_planes() from the page printing procedure.

  Device Coordinates
  ==================
  "Pixmap device space" is the coordinate system used by the "prn" device for
  generating a pixmap and implicit in the API for accessing it (e.g.,
  gdev_prn_copy_scan_lines()). In identifying the directions "left", "bottom",
  "right" and "top" I'm assuming that the x axis is pointing to the right and
  the y axis downwards. This is not concerned with the orientation of device
  space on a sheet printed but is merely a definition of what, e.g., "down"
  means for the eprn device: it is defined as "towards increasing prn y values".
  This makes the code more readable for the case where the real device
  coordinate system (on the sheet) has just this orientation. Too bad for the
  others :-).

  Terms like "width" and "height" are also defined with respect to this
  interpretation, i.e., "width" is an extension in x direction.

  Note that names and interpretations of some of ghostscript's standard
  device structure fields (like 'width', 'height') are also based on this
  convention although this is not explicitly stated. This does however not
  apply to all parameters: for example, HWMargins[] and MediaSize[] are to be
  interpreted in default user space (see gx_default_clip_box()).

  One key assumption of the eprn device is that the top edge of pixmap device
  space is the edge closest to and parallel with the medium's leading edge.
  It is the responsibility of the derived device to ensure this. Usually
  it means that raster lines have to be printed in the order of ascending y.
  (The eprn device will work if the derived device violates this condition, but
  the meaning of user-visible properties of the device would change.)

  The device sets up the device coordinate system such that the device space
  origin is the top left corner of the imageable area where "top" and "left"
  refer to you holding the sheet with the printed side towards you and the
  leading edge at the top. Units and directions are identical with pixmap
  device space.

  Page Descriptions
  =================
  When a PostScript document requests a particular page size by specifying its
  width and height in default user space the eprn device combines this
  information with certain conditions imposed by the derived device and looks
  for a matching page description entry in the printer's capability
  description. The following information from such an entry is needed for
  correctly setting up the relation between default user space and device space:

    - default orientation of the sheet in pixmap device space
      (MS_TRANSVERSE_FLAG; set iff the sheet has width > height in pixmap
      device space)
    - hardware margins

  This part is interpreted by the eprn device.

  In addition, a page description entry may contain a number of flags
  indicating special conditions under which this entry is to be selected or
  carrying information on how to configure the printer. The flags are those
  defined by mediasize.h (except that MS_TRANSVERSE_FLAG and MS_ROTATED_FLAG
  may not be used for this purpose), their interpretation is up to the derived
  device which must request them or to which they will become visible when the
  entry is selected.

  The eprn device takes the following items as the request to be matched with a
  page description entry in the printer's capability description:

    - the media size of the document and, if set, the "LeadingEdge" page device
      parameter
    - a pattern of desired (not necessarily *required*) flags
    - an ordered list of optional flags

  Media size and LeadingEdge are set via PostScript or the command line, the
  flags can be set by the derived device through its device structure instance
  or by calling eprn_set_media_flags(). The optional flags when combined with
  the bitwise OR effectively define a mask of bits which may be ignored when
  checking whether an entry matches the desired flags. The order of optional
  flags is from most to least desirable to ignore.

  The complete request is compared to the list of page descriptions as follows:

   1. If the media size, irrespective of flags, cannot be matched at 5 bp
      tolerance, the request fails with an error message to standard error.
   2. Otherwise a shortened list containing all entries having a matching
      size is compiled, at least conceptually. If the device supports custom
      page sizes, they are listed at the end. This is the "base list".
   3. If LeadingEdge is not null, the MS_TRANSVERSE_FLAG is set or cleared
      accordingly in the pattern of desired flags. This flag is also always
      added to the front of the list of optional flags.
   4. A mask of flags to be ignored is set to zero.
   5. The base list is searched for an entry agreeing with the desired flags
      except possibly for those in the ignore mask.
   6. If no such entry is found, the next flag in the list of optional flags is
      added to the ignore mask and execution continues with step 5. If there is
      no such flag, the request fails and the flag mismatch reporting function
      is called (see below).
   7. If a matching entry is found the list of optional flags is processed
      backwards starting with the flag before the last one added to the ignore
      mask. For each such flag an attempt is made to remove it from the mask.
      If there still is at least one matching entry in the base list the flag
      remains cleared, otherwise it is put back into the mask.
   8. Finally, the first entry matching the request mask and the current
      ignore mask will be selected:
      - its media code will be made available to the derived device in the
        eprn device's 'code' field,
      - the hardware margins will be set from the page description (unless the
        user has explicitly specified a value for the ".HWMargins" page device
        parameter),
      - default user space will be configured based on sheet orientation
        (transverse or not in device space) and page orientation (portrait or
        landscape in default user space).

  Because the error message in step 6 has to report a mismatch on the flags
  and because the interpretation of the flags is fixed by the derived device,
  an error message issued by the eprn device may not be particularly
  illuminating to the user (the user will usually think in terms of the
  interpretation the derived device associates with these flags). Therefore
  issuing this error message can be delegated to a function ("flag mismatch
  reporting function") specified by the derived device in its device structure
  instance.

demos/python/gsapi.py

Python version of the C API in psi/iapi.h.

Copyright (C) 2001-2023 Artifex Software, Inc.

Overview:

    Implemented using Python's ctypes module.

    All functions have the same name as the C function that they wrap.

    Functions raise a GSError exception if the underlying function returned a
    negative error code.

    Functions that don't have out-params return None. Out-params are returned
    directly (using tuples if there are more than one).

    See examples.py for sample usage.

Example usage:

    On Linux/OpenBSD/MacOS:
        Build the ghostscript shared library:
            make sodebug

        Run gsapi.py as a test script:
            GSAPI_LIBDIR=sodebugbin ./demos/python/gsapi.py

    On Windows:
        Build ghostscript dll, for example:
            devenv.com windows/GhostPDL.sln /Build Debug /Project ghostscript

        Run gsapi.py as a test script in a cmd.exe window:
            set GSAPI_LIBDIR=debugbin&& python ./demos/python/gsapi.py

        Run gsapi.py as a test script in a PowerShell window:
            cmd /C "set GSAPI_LIBDIR=debugbin&& python ./demos/python/gsapi.py"

Specifying the Ghostscript shared library:

    Two environmental variables can be used to specify where to find the
    Ghostscript shared library.

    GSAPI_LIB sets the exact path of the ghostscript shared library, else
    GSAPI_LIBDIR sets the directory containing the ghostscript shared
    library. If neither is defined we will use the OS's default location(s) for
    shared libraries.

    If GSAPI_LIB is not defined, the leafname of the shared library is inferred
    from the OS type - libgs.so on Unix, libgs.dylib on MacOS, gsdll64.dll on
    Windows 64.

Requirements:

    Should work on python-2.5+ and python-3.0+, but this might change in
    future.

Limitations as of 2020-07-21:

    Only very limited testing on has been done.

    Tested on Linux, OpenBSD and Windows.

    Only tested with python-3.7 and 2.7.

    We don't provide gsapi_add_fs() or gsapi_remove_fs().

    We only provide display_callback V2, without V3's
    display_adjust_band_height and display_rectangle_request.

HISTORY
~~~~~~~

8 June 1999 Zolt�n K�csi (aka Kocsonya) zoltan@bendor.com.au

        Initial revision.
        No shingling, depletion.
        Colour only.
        Dither matrix is blatantly copied from gslib.c.

17 April 2000 Zolt�n K�csi

        After much play worked out a reasonably simple colour mapping
        that gives fairly good results. It has some very hairy things
        in it but ot seems to work reasonably well on a variety of natural
        as well as artificial images.

CREDIT
~~~~~~
This driver was written from scratch, however, I have used the
HP/BJ driver very heavily as a reference (GhostScript's documentation
needs some working :-). In addition, I got some help in understanding
the more arcane features of the printer by digging into the colour
Epson driver and its documentation (documentation for the Photo EX
did not exist). I thank to the authors of these drivers and the
related docs.

I do also hereby express my despising Epson, Inc. who try to enlarge
Microsoft's monopoly by witholding programming information about such
a commodity item as a printer.

KNOWN BUGS/LIMITATIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Monochrome driver is not finished yet
- The driver is not optimised for speed
- The driver does not support TIFF compression
- Shingling and depletion is not implemented
- The colour correction and ink transfer curve are hardcoded
- The dither matrix is straight stolen from Ghostscript
- The alternative error diffusion included but does not work (yet)

I plan to attend these issues later, however, I don't promise any timeframe
for I have a lot else to do for bread & butter too.

PREFACE
~~~~~~~
The Epson Stylus Photo EX is a colour ink-jet printer.
It can handle papers up to A3. It uses 6 inks, black in one cartridge
and cyan, magenta, yellow, light cyan and light magenta in an other
cartridge. The head has 32 nozzles, with 1/90" spacing.
The maximal resolution is 1440 dpi horizontal 720 dpi vertical.
In 720x720 and 360x360 dpi it supports microweave. To achieve
1440x720 you must use software weaving. It has only one built-in font,
namely 12pt Courier; the printer in general havily relies on the
driver software. It comes with (what else ?) Windows 9x and Mac drivers.

The printer uses the ESC/P Raster protocol. This protocol is somewhat
similar to the ESC/P2 one. Initially Epson refused to give any info
about it. Later (unfortunately after I had already spent lot of time
to reverse engineer it) they released its definition. It could be
found on their website (http://www.ercipd.com/isv/level1/6clr_98b.pdf).
Alas, they removed it, so at the moment I do not know about any existing
docs of the printer.
There are still a few commands which are not covered by the docs
and for example the Windows driver uses them. There are others which
are in the docs, saying that you can find them in other docs but you
can't. Fortunately, these commands apparently have no effect on the
printing process so this driver simply ignores them. Tricky business.

By the way, my personal experience is that Epson tech support is
a joke, or in Usenet lingvo it sucks big time - they know absolutely
nothing about the product they supposed to support. Epson's webpage
contains false info as well (they state that the Photo EX uses ESC/P2,
which is simply not true).

This driver should in theory support the Stylus 700 and the Stylus Photo
as well but I have not tested it on them.

If you think that you can get some useful info from me above of what you
can find below, feel free to email me at zoltan@bendor.com.au.
If you enhance the driver or find a bug *please* send me info about
it.

DRIVER
~~~~~~
The driver was written under Ghostscript 5.10.
This file should contain two drivers, one for colour mode and one for B&W.
The devices are "photoex" and "photoexm". The mono device driver is
catered for (that is, the rendering part knows how to render for B&W)
but it is not finished yet (no device structure and gray colour mapping
procedures) mainly because all my B&W needs are fairly well satisfied
by our laser printer.

The driver features the following:

Supported resolutions

         360x360	Y weaving (not that micro :-) by the printer
         720x720	Y microweave by the driver (quicker than the printer)
        1440x720	Y and X microweave by the driver

        Resolutions other than these will result in a rangecheck error.

Papersize:

        Whatever Ghostscript supports. The printer docs say that if you load
        multiple sheets of transparencies into the tray you should at least
        have 30mm or 1.2" top margin. The driver always sets the smallest
        possible top margin (3mm or 0.12"), it's up to you to comply.

        In addition, the printer says that the bottom margin is at least
        14mm or 0.54". I violate it by setting it to 0.5" or 12.7mm.
        0.5" seems to be a common margin value for documents and you
        would hate it when the last line of your page gets printed on the
        top of the next sheet ...

Options:

        -dDotSize=n

                n = 0		Let the driver choose a dotsize
                n = 1		small dots
                n = 2		more ink
                n = 3		ink flood
                n = 4		'super microdots' (whatever they are, they are *big*)

                The default is 0 which is n=1 for 1440x720, 2 for 720x720 and
                3 for 360x360. Do not use large dots if you don't have to, you
                will soak the paper. If you print 720x720 on normal paper, try
                using n=1.

        -dRender=n

                n = 0		Floyd-Steinbeck error diffusion
                n = 1		Clustered dither
                n = 2		Bendor's error diffusion (experimental, do not use)

                Default is Floyd-Steinbeck error diffusion

        -dLeakage=nn

                nn is between 0 and 25. It only effects Bendor's error diffusion.
                It sets the percentage of the error which is left to 'leak', that
                is it is the coefficient of an exponential decay of the error.
                Experiments show that it can be beneficial on image quality.
                Default is 0 (no leakage).

        -dSplash=nn

                nn is between 0 and 100. It only affects Bendor's error diffusion.
                The ED routine tries to take the increase of dot diameter on certain
                paper types into account.
                It sets the percentage of the ink dot size increase as it splashes
                onto the paper and spreads. 0 means no splashing, 100 means that
                the dot is twice as large as it should be.
                Default is 0.

        -dBinhibit=n

                If n is 1, then if black ink is deposited to a pixel, it will
                inhibit the deposition of any other ink to the same pixel.
                If 0, black ink may be deposited together with other inks.
                Default is on (1).

ESC/P RASTER DOCS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The parts of the ESC/P Raster protocol which I've managed to decipher,
and which are actually used in this driver can be found below.
nn, mm, xx, etc. represent a single byte with a binary value in it.
nnnn, xxxx etc. represent a 16-bit binary number, sent in two bytes,
in little endian order (low byte first). 2-digit numbers are a single
byte in hex. Other chars are themselves.
Quite a few commands are identical to the ESC/P2 commands, these are
marked with (P2).

ESC @								(P2)

        Resets the printer.

ESC ( U 01 00 nn					(P2)

        Sets the unit to 3600/nn dpi. Note that 1440 can not be set !

ESC ( C 02 00 nnnn					(P2)

        Sets the page (paper) length to nnnn units

ESC ( c 04 00 bbbb tttt				(P2)

        Sets the top margin to tttt units, the bottom margin to
        bbbb units. The bottom margin is measured from the top
        of the page not from the bottom of the page !

ESC	U nn							(P2)

        Unidirectional printing

        nn

                The data should contain as many bytes as needed to fill the
                mmmm * nn pixels. Data is presented horizontally, that is,
                the bits of a byte will be represented by eight pixels in
                a row. If the number of collumns is not an integer multiple
                of eight, then some bits from the last byte belonging to the
                row will be discarded and the next row starts on a byte boundary.
                If a bit in a byte is '1' ink is deposited, if '0' not.
                The leftmost pixel is represented by the MSB, rightmost by LSB.
                In case of raw data that's about it.

                In case of run-length encoded data, the following is done:
                The first byte is a counter. If the counter is <= 127 then
                the following counter+1 bytes are uncompressed data.
                If the counter is >= 128 then the following single byte should
                be repeated 257-counter times.

        There are resolution restrictions:

                360x360 nozzle= 1 microweave on
                360x360 nozzle=32 microweave off
                720x 90 nozzle=32 microweave off
                720x720	nozzle= 1 microweave on

        Other combinations are not supported.

ESC ( e 02 00 00 nn

        Sets the amount of ink spat onto the paper.

        nn
        01		microdots (faint printing)
        02		normal dots (not so faint printing)
        03		double dots (full inking)
        04		super microdots (ink is continuously dripping :-)

        Values other than that have apparently no effect.

ESC ( K 02 00 xxxx

        This command is sent by the Windows driver but it is not used
        in the Epson test images. I have not found it having any effect
        whatsoever. The driver does not use it. The Epson docs don't
        mention it.

ESC ( r 02 00 nn mm

        Selects the ink according to this:

        nn mm
        00 00	black
        00 01	magenta
        00 02	cyan
        00 04	yellow
        01 01	light magenta
        01 02	light yellow

ESC ( \ 04 00 xxxx llll

        Horizontal positioning of the head.

        Moves the head to the position llll times 1/xxxx inches from
        the left margin.
        On the example images xxxx was always set to 1440.
        I tried other values in which case the command was ignored,
        so stick to 1440.

ESC ( R ll 00 00 <text> <cc> xxxx nn .. nn
ESC 00 00 00

        This is supposedly sets the printer into 'remote' mode.
        ll is the length of the <text> + 1 which consists of ASCII
        characters (e.g. REMOTE1).
        <cc> is a two-character code, for example "SN" or "LD".
        xxxx is the number of bytes (nn -s) which will follow.
        After that there's either a new <cc> xxxx nn .. nn sequence or
        the ESC 00 00 00.
        I have absolutely no idea about this command and the Epson document
        says that it's in an other document. It's not in that other one.
        The driver does not use it. The printer does not miss it.
        The Epson test images use it and the Windows driver uses it too.
        They send different <cc>-s and different values for identical <cc>-s.
        Go figure.

DRIVER INTERNALS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
First, some comments.
Anything I know about the printer can be found above.
Anything I know about Ghostscript internals (not much) can be
found in the comments in the code. I do not believe in the 'it was hard
to write, it should be hard to read' principle since I once had to
understand my own code.
Therefore, the code has lots of comments in it, sometimes apparently
superfluous but I find it easier to understand the program 6 months
later that way.
I did not follow the Ghostscript or GNU style guide, I write code the way
I like it - I'm a lazy dog :-) I use hard tabs at every 4th position,
I use a *lot* of whitespace (as recommended by K&R in their original
C book) and I have a formatting style similar to the K&R with the
notable exception that I do not indent variable declarations that follow
the curly. Anyway, you can run your favourite C formatter through the
source.

In addition to the above, the driver is not hand-optimised, it assumes
that it is compiled with a good optimising compiler which will handle
common subexpression ellimination, move loop independent code out of
the loop, transform repeated array accesses to cached pointer arithmetics
and so on. The code is much more readable this way and gcc is fairly
good at doing optimisation. Feel free to hand-optimise it.

So, the driver works the following way:

When it has to render a page, first it sets up the basics such as margins
and papersize and alike.

Line scheduling
---------------

Then it calls the line scheduler. To see why do we have a scheduler, you
have to understand weaving. The printer head has 32 nozzles which are
spaced at 8 line intervals. Therefore, it prints 32 lines at a time but they
are distributed over a 256 line high area. Obviously, if you want to print
all the lines under the head, you should pass over the paper 8 times.
You can do it the obvious way:
Print, move down by one line, print ... repeat 8 times then move down
by 256 - 8 lines and start again. Unfortunately, this would result in
stripy images due to the differences between individual nozzles.
Lines 0-7 would be printed by nozzle 0, 8-15 by nozzle 1 and so on. An
8 line band has a visible height, so difference between nozzles will
cause 8-line high bands to appear on the image.

The solution is 'microweave', a funny way of doing interlaced printing.
Instead of moving down 1, 1, 1, 1, .. 1, 248, 1, 1 .. you move down
a constant, larger amount (called a band). This amount must be chosen
in such a way that each line will be printed and preferably it will be
printed only once.

Let for example the move down amount (the band) be 31. Let's say,
in band N nozzle 31 is over line 300, in which case nozzle 30 is over
line 292. We move the head down by 31 lines, then line 299 will be
under nozzle 27 and line 307 under nozzle 28.
Next move, nozzle 23 will print line 298 and nozzle 24 line 306, then
19/297 20/305, 15/296 16/304, 11/295 12/303, 7/294 8/302, 3/293 4/302,
0/292 3/301 which covers the entire area between 292 and 307.
The same will apply to any other area on the page. Also note that
adjacent lines are always printed by different nozzles.
You probably have realised that line 292 was printed in the first pass
and in the last one. In this case, of course, the line must not be printed
twice, one or the other pass should not deliver data to the nozzle which
passes over this line.

Now there's a twist. When the horizontal resolution is 1440 dpi you have
to print each line twice, first depositing all even pixels then offset
the head by 1/1440" and deposit all odd pixels (the printer can only
print with 720 dpi but you can initially position the head with 1440 dpi
resolution). You could do it the easy way, passing over the same area
twice but you can do better. You can find a band size which will result
each line being printed twice. Instead of suppressing the double print,
you use this mechanism to print the odd and the even pixels.
Now if you print one line's odd pixels, obviously, all lines belonging
to the 31 other nozzles of the head will have their odd pixels printed too.
Therefore, you have to keep track which lines have been printed in which
phase and try to find an odd-even phase assignment to bands so that each line
has both groups printed (and each group only once).
The added bonus is that even the same line will be printed by two different
nozzles thus effects of nozzle differences can be decreased further.

The whole issue is further complicated with the beginning of the page and
the end of the page. When you print the first 8 lines you *must* use the
print, down by 1, print ... method but then you have to switch over to the
banding method. To do it well, you should minimise the number of lines which
are printed out of band. This optimisation is not complex but not trivial
either. Our solution is to employ precalculated tables for the first 8 lines.
(Epson's solution is not to print the 'problematic' lines at all - they
warn you in the manual that at the top and bottom you may have "slight
distortions". Analyzing their output reveals the reason ... ).
The bottom is different. It is easier, because you are already banding, so
you can't screw up the rest of the image. On the other hand, you can't use
tables because these tables would depend on the page height which you don't
know a priori. Our solution is to switch to single line mode when we can
not do the banding any more and try to finish the page with the minimal
amount of passes.

So, first the driver calls the scheduler which returns a list of lines which
it dispatched to print in the current band. Then the driver checks if it has
all these lines halftoned. Since the head covers an area of 256 lines, we
have to buffer that many lines (actually, 256-7). As the head moves down,
we can flush lines which it has left and halftone the new ones.

Colour transformations
----------------------

The next important issue is the colour transformation. The reason for doing
this is that the ink is not perfect. Ideally, you have 3 inks, namely cyan
magenta and yellow. Mixing these you can have all colours. Now the inks
are not pure, that is the cyan ink contains some particles that have a
colour other than the ideal cyan and so on. In addition, the inks are
not exactly cyan, magenta and yellow. Therefore, you have to do some
transformations that will map the ideal C, M, Y values to amounts of
ink of the real kind. You also have a black ink. Although in theory
mixing C, M, Y in equal amount will give you black, it doesn't exactly
work that way. In addition, black ink is cheap compared to the colour
so if you can use black, you rather use that. On top of all that,
because of other effects (ink splashing on the paper and things like that)
you have to apply some non-linear functions to get reasonable colours.

Halftoning
----------

The driver has different halftoning methods.
There is the classic Floyd-Stenberg error diffusion. There is an other
ED, of which I'm hammering the matrix. The matrix is larger than the
FS one and IMHO results in somewhat lower halftoning noise. However,
it completely screws up some flat colours so don't use it.
There is also dithering, which is quick but noisy.

For any halftoning method, it is assumed that the haltoning can be
done on the 4 colours (CMYK) separately and all interdependencies are
already handled. It is an optimistic assumption, however, close enough.

You can add any halftoning method you like by writing a halftoner
module. A halftoner module consists of 4 functions:

- Init, which is called before halftoning starts.
- Threshold, which should return a number which tells the driver how many
  empty lines needed before halftoning can be stopped (i.e. for how many
  lines will a line affect halftoning of subsequent lines).
- Halftone, which halftones one colour of one line
- EndOfLine which is called when all colours of a scanline are halftoned,
  you can do your housekeeping functions here.

For example, in the case of ED init() clears the error buffers, threshold()
returns ~5 (5 empty lines are enough for the accumulated error to go to
almost zero), endofline() shuffles the error buffers and halftone() itself
does the error diffusion. In case of dithering, threshold is 0 (dithering
has no memory), init and endofline do nothing and halftone simply
dithers a line.

A few options are available for all halftoners:

- the black is rendered first. Now this black line is presented to all
  further passes. If a pixel is painted black, there's no point to
  deposit any other colour on it, even if the halftoning itself would do.
  Therefore, an already set black pixel can block the halftoning of colours
  for that pixel. Whether this thing is activated or not is a command line
  switch (default is on). Your halftoner may choose to ignore this flag.

- the intensity value of the light-cyan and light-magenta ink can be
  set from the command line. My experience is that the default 127 is
  good enough, but you can override it if you want to.

Apart from these features, each halftoner can have all sorts of other
switches. Currently there are switches for the Bendor ED, see the
comments in front of the BendorLine() function to see what they are.

Postprocessing
--------------

After lines are halftoned, they are packed into bitstreams. If you use
1440x720 then the 2 passes for the horizontal interleave are separated.
Postprocessing should also do the shingling/depletion, but it is not
yet done.

Compression
-----------

The driver, before it sends the data to the printer, compresses it using
RLE (run-length encoding) compression. It is not very effective but still
more than nothing. I have not yet ventured into using TIFF as output format,
it may come later.

See the OpenType specification, "The 'OS/2' and Windows Metrics Table" for details
of the fstype parameter. This is a bitfield, currently we forbid embedding of fonts
with these bits set:
bit 1	0x0002	Fonts that have only this bit set must not be modified, embedded or
                 exchanged in any manner.
bit 9	0x0200	Bitmap embedding only.
Note for Restricted License embedding (bit 1), this must be the only level of embedding
selected (see the OpenType spec).


## Files:

We should also preserve the licensed embedding rights, to prevent
'laundering' a TrueType font. These can be non-zero even when embedding is permitted.

This file is a library for parsing options in your shell scripts along
with assorted other useful supporting features that you can make use
of too.

For the simplest scripts you might need only:

  #!/bin/sh
  . relative/path/to/funclib.sh
  . relative/path/to/options-parser
  scriptversion=1.0
  func_options ${1+"$@"}
  eval set dummy "$func_options_result"; shift
  ...rest of your script...

In order for the '--version' option to work, you will need to have a
suitably formatted comment like the one at the top of this file
starting with '# Written by ' and ending with '# Copyright'.

For '-h' and '--help' to work, you will also need a one line
description of your script's purpose in a comment directly above the
'# Written by ' line, like the one at the top of this file.

The default options also support '--debug', which will turn on shell
execution tracing (see the comment above debug_cmd below for another
use), and '--verbose' and the func_verbose function to allow your script
to display verbose messages only when your user has specified
'--verbose'.

After sourcing this file, you can plug in processing for additional
options by amending the variables from the 'Configuration' section
below, and following the instructions in the 'Option parsing'
section further down.


## Files:
freetype/builds/unix/ltmain.sh

func_version
------------
Echo version message to standard output and exit.
The version message is extracted from the calling file's header
comments, with leading '# ' stripped:
  1. First display the progname and version
  2. Followed by the header comment line matching  /^# Written by /
  3. Then a blank line followed by the first following line matching
     /^# Copyright /
  4. Immediately followed by any lines between the previous matches,
     except lines preceding the intervening completely blank line.
For example, see the header comments of this file.

@enum:
  FT_FSTYPE_XXX

@description:
  A list of bit flags used in the `fsType` field of the OS/2 table in a
  TrueType or OpenType font and the `FSType` entry in a PostScript font.
  These bit flags are returned by @FT_Get_FSType_Flags; they inform
  client applications of embedding and subsetting restrictions
  associated with a font.

  See
  https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/FontPolicies.pdf
  for more details.

@values:
  FT_FSTYPE_INSTALLABLE_EMBEDDING ::
    Fonts with no fsType bit set may be embedded and permanently
    installed on the remote system by an application.

  FT_FSTYPE_RESTRICTED_LICENSE_EMBEDDING ::
    Fonts that have only this bit set must not be modified, embedded or
    exchanged in any manner without first obtaining permission of the
    font software copyright owner.

  FT_FSTYPE_PREVIEW_AND_PRINT_EMBEDDING ::
    The font may be embedded and temporarily loaded on the remote
    system.  Documents containing Preview & Print fonts must be opened
    'read-only'; no edits can be applied to the document.

  FT_FSTYPE_EDITABLE_EMBEDDING ::
    The font may be embedded but must only be installed temporarily on
    other systems.  In contrast to Preview & Print fonts, documents
    containing editable fonts may be opened for reading, editing is
    permitted, and changes may be saved.

  FT_FSTYPE_NO_SUBSETTING ::
    The font may not be subsetted prior to embedding.

  FT_FSTYPE_BITMAP_EMBEDDING_ONLY ::
    Only bitmaps contained in the font may be embedded; no outline data
    may be embedded.  If there are no bitmaps available in the font,
    then the font is unembeddable.

@note:
  The flags are ORed together, thus more than a single value can be
  returned.

  While the `fsType` flags can indicate that a font may be embedded, a
  license with the font vendor may be separately required to use the
  font in this way.

Homepage:

This software was written by Alexander Peslyak in 2001.  No copyright is

(This is a heavily cut-down "BSD license".)

This differs from Colin Plumb's older public domain implementation in that
no exactly 32-bit integer data type is required (any 32-bit or wider
unsigned integer data type will do), there's no compile-time endianness
configuration, and the function prototypes match OpenSSL's.  No code from
Colin Plumb's implementation has been reused; this comment merely compares
the properties of the two independent implementations.

The primary goals of this implementation are portability and ease of use.
It is meant to be fast, but not as fast as possible.  Some known
optimizations are not included to reduce source code size and avoid
compile-time configuration.

PostScript names are given in brackets if they differ from the
family name.  The version numbers, together with the copyright or
release year data, are taken from fonts available to the
developers.
Note that later versions of the fonts might be no longer tricky;
for example, `MingLiU' version 7.00 (file `mingliu.ttc' from
Windows 7) is an ordinary TTC with non-tricky subfonts.

In 2.11: When I create a RGB profile, set the copyright data with an empty string,
then call cmsMD5computeID on said profile, the program crashes.


## Files:

Set an empty copyright tag. This should log an error.

 File:        tesseractclass.cpp
 Description: The Tesseract class. It holds/owns everything needed
              to run Tesseract on a single language, and also a set of
              sub-Tesseracts to run sub-languages. For thread safety, *every*
              variable that was previously global or static (except for
              constant data, and some visual debugging flags) has been moved
              in here, directly, or indirectly.
              This makes it safe to run multiple Tesseracts in different
              threads in parallel, and keeps the different language
              instances separate.
              Some global functions remain, but they are isolated re-entrant
              functions that operate on their arguments. Functions that work
              on variable data have been moved to an appropriate class based
              mostly on the directory hierarchy. For more information see
              slide 6 of "2ArchitectureAndDataStructures" in
 https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7l10Bj_LprhbUlIUFlCdGtDYkE/edit?usp=sharing
              Some global data and related functions still exist in the
              training-related code, but they don't interfere with normal
              recognition operation.

 Description: The Tesseract class. It holds/owns everything needed
              to run Tesseract on a single language, and also a set of
              sub-Tesseracts to run sub-languages. For thread safety, *every*
              global variable goes in here, directly, or indirectly.
              This makes it safe to run multiple Tesseracts in different
              threads in parallel, and keeps the different language
              instances separate.

This module may look unnecessarily verbose, but here's the philosophy...

ALL processing of the reject map is done in this module. There are lots of
separate calls to set reject/accept flags. These have DELIBERATELY been kept
distinct so that this module can decide what to do.

Basically, there is a flag for each sort of rejection or acceptance. This
provides a history of what has happened to EACH character.

Determining whether a character is CURRENTLY rejected depends on implicit
understanding of the SEQUENCE of possible calls. The flags are defined and
grouped in the REJ_FLAGS enum. These groupings are used in determining a
characters CURRENT rejection status. Basically, a character is ACCEPTED if

    none of the permanent rej flags are set
  AND (    the character has never been rejected
      OR an accept flag is set which is LATER than the latest reject flag )

IT IS FUNDAMENTAL THAT ANYONE HACKING THIS CODE UNDERSTANDS THE SIGNIFICANCE
OF THIS IMPLIED TEMPORAL ORDERING OF THE FLAGS!!!!

 Description: Quasi-random sequence generator class.
 Author:      Ranjith Unnikrishnan

 Class to generate a (deterministic) quasi-random Van der Corput sequence that
 covers the interval [0,N) without repetition.

 The sequence is generated by reversing the base-2 representation of the
 sequence of natural numbers {0, 1,... M-1}, where M is 2^{num_bits_} and
 num_bits is the minimum number of bits required to represent N. If a reversed
 numbers is >= N it is rejected and the next natural number is considered
 until a valid output number is found.

  This file contains a set of general purpose list manipulation routines.
  These routines can be used in a wide variety of ways to provide several
  different popular data structures. A new list can be created by declaring
  a variable of type 'LIST', and can be initialized with the value 'NIL_LIST'.
  All of these routines check for the NIL_LIST condition before dereferencing
  pointers.  NOTE:  There is a users' manual available in printed form from
  Mark Seaman at (303) 350-4492 at Greeley Hard Copy.

  To implement a STACK use:

  push         to add to the Stack             l = push(l, (LIST)"jim");
  pop          to remove items from the Stack  l = pop(l);
  first_node   to access the head              name = (char *)first_node(l);

  To implement a QUEUE use:

  push_last    to add to the Queue              l = push_last(l, (LIST)"x");
  pop          remove items from the Queue      l = pop(l);
  first_node   to access the head               name = (char *)first_node (l);

  To implement LISP like functions use:

  first_node   CAR                              x = (int)first_node(l);
  rest         CDR                              l = list_rest (l);
  push         CONS                             l = push(l, (LIST)this);
  last         LAST                             x = last(l);
  concat       APPEND                           l = concat(r, s);
  count        LENGTH                           x = count(l);
  search       MEMBER                           if (search(l, x, nullptr))

  The following rules of closure exist for the functions provided.
  a = first_node (push (a, b))
  b = list_rest (push (a, b))
  a = push (pop (a), a))        For all a <> NIL_LIST
  a = reverse (reverse (a))

                           =======

 BASICS:
 -------
 first_node        - Macro to return the first list node (not the cell).
 list_rest         - Macro the return the second list cell
 pop               - Destroy one list cell
 push              - Create one list cell and set the node and next fields

 ITERATION:
 -----------------
 iterate           - Macro to create a for loop to visit each cell.

 LIST CELL COUNTS:
 -----------------
 count             - Returns the number of list cells in the list.
 last              - Returns the last list cell.

 TRANSFORMS:             (Note: These functions all modify the input list.)
 ----------
 delete_d          - Removes the requested elements from the list.
 push_last         - Add a new element onto the end of a list.

 SETS:
 -----
 search            - Return the pointer to the list cell whose node matches.

 CELL OPERATIONS:
 -----------------
 destroy           - Return all list cells in a list.
 destroy_nodes     - Apply a function to each list cell and destroy the list.
 set_rest          - Assign the next field in a list cell.

             Instances are created using a font description string
             (eg. "Arial Italic 12"; see pango_font_info.h for the format)
             and the page dimensions. Other renderer properties such as
             spacing, ligaturization, as well a preprocessing behavior such
             as removal of unrenderable words and a special n-gram mode may
             be set using respective set_* methods.

tesseract/src/training/text2image.cpp

File:        text2image.cpp
Description: Program to generate OCR training pages. Given a text file it
             outputs an image with a given font and degradation.

             Note that since the results depend on the fonts available on
             your system, running the code on a different machine, or
             different OS, or even at a different time on the same machine,
             may produce different fonts even if --font is given explicitly.
             To see names of available fonts, use --list_available_fonts with
             the appropriate --fonts_dir path.
             Specifying --use_only_legacy_fonts will restrict the available
             fonts to those listed in legacy_fonts.h

             direct use in ICU C and C++ APIs.
Author:      Fredrik Roubert
Created:     Thu July 4 2013

Features:
- The constructor initializes the internal UErrorCode to U_ZERO_ERROR,
  removing one common source of errors.
- Same use in C APIs taking a UErrorCode* (pointer) and C++ taking
  UErrorCode& (reference), via conversion operators.
- Automatic checking for success when it goes out of scope. On failure,
  the destructor will log an error message and exit.

Most of ICU will handle errors gracefully and provide sensible fallbacks.
Using IcuErrorCode, it is therefore possible to write very compact code
that does sensible things on failure and provides logging for debugging.

Example:
IcuErrorCode icuerrorcode;
return collator.compareUTF8(a, b, icuerrorcode) == UCOL_EQUAL;

 ScrollView is designed as an UI which can be run remotely. This is the
 client code for it, the server part is written in java. The client consists
 mainly of 2 parts:
 The "core" ScrollView which sets up the remote connection,
 takes care of event handling etc.
 The other part of ScrollView consists of predefined API calls through LUA,
 which can basically be used to get a zoomable canvas in which it is possible
 to draw lines, text etc.
 Technically, thanks to LUA, its even possible to bypass the here defined LUA
 API calls at all and generate a java user interface from scratch (or
 basically generate any kind of java program, possibly even dangerous ones).

 A SVMenuNode is an entity which contains the mapping from a menu entry on
 the server side to the corresponding associated commands on the client.
 It is designed to be a tree structure with a root node, which can then be
 used to generate the appropriate messages to the server to display the
 menu structure there.
 A SVMenuNode can both be used in the context_ of popup menus as well as
 menu bars.
