                    GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 19 November 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the software.

  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
source code to the public.

  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
code of the modified version.

  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
this license.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source
shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
following paragraph.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version
3 of the GNU General Public License.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU Affero General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its
interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive
of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different
solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
specific requirements.

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.

                  FreeType font driver for BDF fonts

                       Francesco Zappa Nardelli
                  <francesco.zappa.nardelli@ens.fr>


Introduction
************

BDF (Bitmap Distribution Format) is a bitmap font format defined by Adobe,
which is intended to be easily understood by both humans and computers.
This code implements a BDF driver for the FreeType library, following the
Adobe Specification V 2.2.  The specification of the BDF font format is
available from Adobe's web site:

  https://adobe-type-tools.github.io/font-tech-notes/pdfs/5005.BDF_Spec.pdf

Many good bitmap fonts in bdf format come with XFree86 (www.XFree86.org).
They do not define vertical metrics, because the X Consortium BDF
specification has removed them.


Encodings
*********

[This section is out of date, retained for historical reasons.  BDF
 properties can be retrieved with `FT_Get_BDF_Property`, character set ID
 values with `FT_Get_BDF_Charset_ID`.]

The variety of encodings that accompanies bdf fonts appears to encompass the
small set defined in freetype.h.  On the other hand, two properties that
specify encoding and registry are usually defined in bdf fonts.

I decided to make these two properties directly accessible, leaving to the
client application the work of interpreting them.  For instance:


  #include FT_INTERNAL_BDF_TYPES_H

  FT_Face          face;
  BDF_Public_Face  bdfface;


  FT_New_Face( library, ..., &face );

  bdfface = (BDF_Public_Face)face;

  if ( ( bdfface->charset_registry == "ISO10646" ) &&
       ( bdfface->charset_encoding == "1" )        )
    [..]


Thus the driver always exports `ft_encoding_none' as face->charmap.encoding.
FT_Get_Char_Index's behavior is unmodified, that is, it converts the ULong
value given as argument into the corresponding glyph number.

If the two properties are not available, Adobe Standard Encoding should be
assumed.


Anti-Aliased Bitmaps
********************

The driver supports an extension to the BDF format as used in Mark Leisher's
xmbdfed bitmap font editor.  Microsoft's SBIT tool expects bitmap fonts in
that format for adding anti-aliased them to TrueType fonts.  It introduces a
fourth field to the `SIZE' keyword which gives the bpp value (bits per
pixel) of the glyph data in the font.  Possible values are 1 (the default),
2 (four gray levels), 4 (16 gray levels), and 8 (256 gray levels).  The
driver returns either a bitmap with 1 bit per pixel or a pixmap with 8bits
per pixel (using 4, 16, and 256 gray levels, respectively).


Known problems
**************

- A font is entirely loaded into memory.  Obviously, this is not the Right
  Thing(TM).  If you have big fonts I suggest you convert them into PCF
  format (using the bdftopcf utility): the PCF font drive of FreeType can
  perform incremental glyph loading.

When I have some time, I will implement on-demand glyph parsing.

- Except for encodings properties, client applications have no visibility of
  the PCF_Face object.  This means that applications cannot directly access
  font tables and must trust FreeType.

- Currently, glyph names are ignored.

  I plan to give full visibility of the BDF_Face object in an upcoming
  revision of the driver, thus implementing also glyph names.

- As I have never seen a BDF font that defines vertical metrics, vertical
  metrics are (parsed and) discarded.  If you own a BDF font that defines
  vertical metrics, please let me know (I will implement them in 5-10
  minutes).

This driver is based on excellent Mark Leisher's bdf library.  If you
find something good in this driver you should probably thank him, not
me.

                  FreeType font driver for PCF fonts

                       Francesco Zappa Nardelli
                  <francesco.zappa.nardelli@ens.fr>


Introduction
************

PCF (Portable Compiled Format) is a binary bitmap font format, largely used
in X world. This code implements a PCF driver for the FreeType library.
Glyph images are loaded into memory only on demand, thus leading to a small
memory footprint.

Information on the PCF font format can only be worked out from
`pcfread.c', and `pcfwrite.c', to be found, for instance, in the XFree86
(www.xfree86.org) source tree (xc/lib/font/bitmap/).

Many good bitmap fonts in bdf format come with XFree86: they can be
compiled into the pcf format using the `bdftopcf' utility.


Supported hardware
******************

The driver has been tested on linux/x86 and sunos5.5/sparc.  In both
cases the compiler was gcc.  When back in Paris, I will test it also
on linux/alpha.


Encodings
*********

Use `FT_Get_BDF_Charset_ID' to access the encoding and registry.

The driver always exports `ft_encoding_none' as face->charmap.encoding.
FT_Get_Char_Index() behavior is unmodified, that is, it converts the ULong
value given as argument into the corresponding glyph number.


Known problems
**************

- dealing explicitly with encodings breaks the uniformity of FreeType 2
  API.

- except for encodings properties, client applications have no
  visibility of the PCF_Face object.  This means that applications
  cannot directly access font tables and are obliged to trust
  FreeType.

- currently, glyph names and ink_metrics are ignored.

I plan to give full visibility of the PCF_Face object in the next
release of the driver, thus implementing also glyph names and
ink_metrics.

- height is defined as (ascent - descent).  Is this correct?

- if unable to read size information from the font, PCF_Init_Face
  sets available_size->width and available_size->height to 12.

- too many english grammar errors in the readme file :-(

Keith Packard wrote the pcf driver found in XFree86.  His work is at
the same time the specification and the sample implementation of the
PCF format.  Undoubtedly, this driver is inspired from his work.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                          675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

        Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General

What is pcl3?
=============
pcl3, formerly called hpdj, is a ghostscript device driver for printers
understanding Hewlett-Packard's Printer Command Language, Level 3+ (PCL 3+).
Some printer models (currently exclusively HP DeskJets) are explicitly
supported, but there is also generic support for other PCL-3+ printers.
So far I have not heard of any PCL-3 printer for which the driver cannot be
used at all and it even works for some printers which claim to be
PCL-3-conforming but aren't. For a more positive statement, i.e., a list of
printer models for which pcl3 is currently known to work and how, see the file
doc/reports.txt.



Conditions of use
=================
pcl3 is free software and can be used under the terms of the GNU Lesser General
Public License (LGPL), Version 2.1 (February 1999). You can find a copy of the
LGPL in the pcl3 distribution, in several software packages distributed by the
Free Software Foundation, and at http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html.

This implies in particular that you are using pcl3 AT YOUR OWN RISK!



Status of this release
======================
This is version 3.3 of pcl3, released 2001-08-19. This is an ordinary
(non-beta) release. Read the manual page to learn about the supported
functionality and restrictions.



Files needed
============
First, you need a ghostscript distribution. This version of pcl3 has been
successfully integrated with the following ghostscript distributions:

  - AFPL ghostscript 7.0
  - GNU ghostscript 6.51

Other ghostscript versions than those mentioned here are very likely to work,
too.

To obtain a ghostscript distribution, visit http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost.
You will also need some third-party archives in addition. See the URL just
mentioned or check Make.htm in the ghostscript distribution you have obtained.

Second, you need a font distribution containing at least a basic set of
PostScript fonts. Such a set is distributed with ghostscript as an "std" and an
"other" archive. Because font files are PostScript files, they are normally not
restricted to a particular version of ghostscript although the archives have a
ghostscript version number in their file names. Some of the possibilities are:

      ghostscript-fonts-std-6.0.tar.gz
      ghostscript-fonts-other-6.0.tar.gz
      gnu-gs-fonts-std-6.0.tar.gz
      gnu-gs-fonts-std-5.50.tar.gz
      gnu-gs-fonts-other-6.0.tar.gz
      gnu-gs-fonts-other-5.50.tar.gz

Unless you already have such a set on your system, fetch at least an "std"
archive and choose the one with the highest version number you can readily lay
your hands on. Different file names do not necessarily mean different contents.

  A side remark: The "StandardSymL" font dated 1998-03-26 (first present in
  a 5.10 font archive) contains the Euro glyph. However, it has the wrong
  PostScript name ("euro" instead of "Euro") and the wrong default encoding
  (decimal 240 instead of octal 240). This is corrected in the version dated
  1999-10-21. Ghostscript's "SymbolEncoding" encoding vector had the same bugs
  in gs 5.50 and this was fixed in gs 6.0.

Third, you need the pcl3 distribution:

      pcl3-<version>.tar.gz

But if you are reading this file, you should already have it. If not,
you can obtain the current distribution through the following URL:

      http://home.t-online.de/home/Martin.Lottermoser/pcl3.html

I am distributing pcl3 only in the form of gzipped tar archives. If you wish to
compile pcl3 on a non-UNIX platform, you need gzip, tar (on a Microsoft Windows
system, you can use the Cygnus port of the GNU tools, available from
http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin), and a command to convert text files from
LF-terminated lines to whatever the line termination conventions are on your
system.



How to compile ghostscript with pcl3
====================================
You need an ISO-C-conforming compiler and library in order to compile pcl3.

The following description is heavily biased towards UNIX systems and in
particular Linux.

 1. Unpack the core distribution

    This is the file ghostscript-N.NN.tar or gnu-gs-N.NN.tar. Unpacking it will
    create a subdirectory "gsN.NN" in the current directory.

    In order to clearly identify directories I'm going to use the following
    expressions:
    - "gs directory": the directory gsN.NN you have just created
    - "documentation directory": In gs 5.50 this is identical to the
      gs directory, in newer versions it is the subdirectory "doc" in the
      gs directory.
    - "source directory": In gs 5.50 this is identical to the gs directory,
      in newer versions it is the subdirectory "src" in the gs directory.

 2. Read Make.htm in the documentation directory on how to compile ghostscript.
    In particular, you should learn

      - which other files you need to unpack and how, and
      - what the platform-specific make file for your platform is.

 3. Unpack the other files needed (except the font files) as directed by
    Make.htm.

 4. Unpack pcl3, preferably in the gs directory. The file pcl3-<version>.tar
    unpacks into a subdirectory pcl3-<version> with only three files:

	README-cover
	pcl3.tar	the distribution proper
	pcl3.tar.sig	an OpenPGP signature for pcl3.tar

    Make the directory accessible under the name "pcl3" from the gs directory,
    either by renaming it or by creating an appropriate symbolic link. Then
    change into the pcl3 directory and unpack pcl3.tar from there. This should
    give you in addition the following regular files in that directory:

	BUGS		pcl3's bug list
	LGPL		text of the GNU LGPL
	NEWS		list of user-visible changes between versions
	README		this file

    Furthermore, a number of subdirectories will have been created:

	doc		documentation
        eprn            C source code for the eprn device on which pcl3 is based
	lib		cups-pcl3, example.mcf, if-pcl3
        ppd             PostScript printer description files
	ps		PostScript files
	src		C source code and build files for pcl3

 5. Extend contrib.mak in the source directory.

    The pcl3 distribution contains extension files "src/contrib.mak-N.NN.add"
    for this purpose, where "N.NN" is a ghostscript version (at least for all
    ghostscript distributions listed in "Files needed" above). These files
    contain text to be inserted into contrib.mak at some point, for example at
    the end. An extension file might work for other gs versions in addition to
    the designated one.

    The extension files contain an initial comment which gives you some
    further instructions (compile options, files shared with hpdj, available
    devices).

 6. Add at least "$(DD)pcl3.dev" ("pcl3.dev" in gs 5.50) to one of the
    DEVICE_DEVS* variables in the platform-specific make file. The conventional
    place is DEVICE_DEVS3, DEVICE_DEVS4, or DEVICE_DEVS5. For a complete list
    of pcl3 devices you can define here, see the contrib.mak-N.NN.add file.
    You might also wish to modify the device and feature lists in other
    respects.

    On a Linux system, the file to edit is unix-gcc.mak.

 7. Read the file doc/gs-mods.txt about modifications I suggest for making in
    ghostscript's source code or configuration files.

 8. Other changes to the platform-specific make file

    For a UNIX system and if you wish to install the software in a non-default
    directory, edit the make variable "prefix" (normally /usr/local).
    This directory must exist before step 10.

    If you intend to use the X Window System, check whether the values for the
    variables XINCLUDE, XLIBDIRS, and XLIBS are correct. On Linux, they should
    usually be "-I/usr/X11R6/include", "-L/usr/X11R6/lib", and
    "Xt SM ICE Xext X11", respectively. You can ignore XINCLUDE if one of the
    directories searched by the compiler anyway contains an appropriate "X11"
    subdirectory (e.g., there is a link from /usr/include/X11 to
    /usr/X11R6/include/X11).

 9. On a UNIX system, check that the platform-specific make file (unix-gcc.mak
    for Linux) is available to make from the gs directory (or use "-f"). Then,
    in the gs directory, type "make" to generate the gs binary, and
    "make pcl3opts" to generate the pcl3opts binary. The latter step is likely
    to fail if you are not on an XPG-conforming UNIX system.

10. Install: "make install pcl3-install".

    If you are not on a UNIX system, you'll probably have to omit the
    "pcl3-install" part. Instead, copy pcl3's doc/*.html files and the compiled
    pcl3opts binary (provided it did compile) to appropriate places yourself.

    If "make pcl3-install" gives you a usage message from the "instcopy"
    command you've forgotten "make pcl3opts" in step 9.

    The "make pcl3opts" call, if successful, has also generated two NLS message
    catalogues for pcl3opts in ghostscript's object file directory ("obj" in
    the gs directory): pcl3opts-en.cat (English) and pcl3opts-de.cat (German).
    These catalogues are not installed automatically. If you wish to use them,
    copy each file into an appropriate NLS directory under a name matching your
    NLSPATH conventions with "pcl3opts" for %N. (On Linux the default value for
    NLSPATH usually includes /usr/share/locale/%L/%N and
    /usr/share/locale/%L/LC_MESSAGES/%N.) You need the English catalogue only
    if you want pcl3opts to issue media sizes in inches instead of millimetres.

    Note that pcl3's PostScript example files (subdirectory "ps") are also not
    installed. If you find them useful, copy them to an appropriate place
    yourself.

11. Install the fonts.

    First call the newly generated "gs" with the option "-h". The output will
    show you ghostscript's search path. The fonts should be present in one of
    these directories. On UNIX systems, the convention is to use a ".../fonts"
    directory for this purpose. Note that newer font distributions unpack into
    "./fonts" and some older ones into ".".

    If you already have a ghostscript installation somewhere else on your
    system and its font directory is not included in the font path of your new
    gs binary, you can create a symbolic link from the ".../fonts" directory to
    your installed fonts, or use the environment variable GS_FONTPATH to direct
    gs to the directory/ies in question.

12. This is a good point to take a first look at pcl3's documentation if you
    haven't done that yet. It is available as a manual page (type "man gs-pcl3")
    and in HTML format (open gs-pcl3.html in the installed ghostscript's
    documentation directory with an HTML browser).

13. If your printer is not directly supported by pcl3 and you wish the driver
    to be correctly informed about supported media sizes and the associated
    hardware margins, look into the file lib/example.mcf and then create a
    media configuration file for your printer from information in its manual.
    You must at least specify an entry for the default page size (A4 or
    US Letter as selected in your ghostscript configuration).

    If you have selected to set PCL3_MEDIA_FILE in step 5, the media file
    you have just created should be installed under that path name.

14. Integration with a spool system

    This depends on your spooler :-). The minimum you need is the ability to
    print a file without any modifications by spool commands. In that case
    you can generate a PCL file by calling ghostscript with option values
    appropriate for your current needs and pass the generated file through the
    spool system for printing. Such spool queues are usually called "raw"
    queues.

    If you are using CUPS (Common UNIX Printing System, http://www.cups.org),
    you can proceed as follows:

      - Create a file ppd/gs.ppd describing the site-specific properties of
        your ghostscript installation.
      - Select a PPD file suitable for your printer model and copy it into
	CUPS' "model" directory using the ppd/catppd script.
      - Copy the lib/cups-pcl3 filter to CUPS' "filter" directory.
      - Install a new print queue based on the new PPD file.

    The details of the first two steps are described in the ppd/README file.
    You should also at some stage read the initial comments in lib/cups-pcl3.

    Most Linux systems still use a Berkeley spooler (lpr/lprm/lpq) which maps
    the queue name in the print request to a call to some backend command,
    based on /etc/printcap. Frequently, the backend is an intelligent filter
    which will examine the contents of the file to be printed and perform
    appropriate processing based on the file type.

    Because with an ordinary Berkeley spooler one cannot pass command line
    options to the backend, it is a good idea to install several print queues
    for those option combinations one needs frequently. You could for example
    install seven print queues: one for passing any file to the printer
    unchanged, three for monochrome and three for colour printing, each of the
    last two groups having a queue for "draft", "normal" and "presentation"
    quality.

    If you are on a machine with an AT&T spool system (lp/cancel/lpstat),
    one queue can be sufficient because you can pass command line options to
    the backend. However, if your printer has different hardware configurations
    (either black or CMY cartridge, either banner or tray feed) and you cannot
    completely control when print jobs are submitted, you should still install
    separate queues for these configurations, take steps to make it at least
    likely that the jobs submitted to each queue have the necessary properties,
    and enable only the queue agreeing with the printer's current configuration.

    You also need only one queue independent of the spool system if you have a
    spooler frontend capable of inserting PostScript setup commands into the
    document to be printed or if such a document manager is part of your
    spooler (the latter applies to CUPS). The pcl3 distribution contains the
    necessary PPD files for these cases; read the file ppd/README for further
    instructions. Note that the remarks above on separate queues for distinct
    hardware configurations apply also to this case.

    The pcl3 distribution contains configurable input filters for the Berkeley
    spooler and for CUPS in the files "lib/if-pcl3" and "lib/cups-pcl3",
    respectively. Read the initial comments in these files for further
    instructions.

    You should also not forget to skim the "OPTIONS" and "CONFIGURATION"
    sections in pcl3's manual page: some parts are particularly relevant for
    spooler backends.

15. Test your configuration by printing a few example documents.

    As a first step and in particular when you are using a media configuration
    file, print some of the margin test files ps/margins-*.ps appropriate for
    your current media size. They should show marks with a distance of 25 mm or
    1 in (depending on the media size) from the margins. If you find deviations
    from what you expect, read the manual page and in particular the
    description of how to use the "Margins" or "PageOffset" entries to correct
    misalignments.

    For trying out various rendering parameters, ps/levels-test.ps is a good
    test file, in particular if you print through a spooler, because the
    printed page will tell you which settings were effective.

Purpose and Format of PPD Files, Document Managers
**************************************************
Some PostScript commands (e.g., for duplex printing) are not concerned with
what appears on the page but control the way a document is printed independent
of its contents. Such commands are usually not created by the application
generating the PostScript document but are inserted at the user's request when
actually printing the file. In addition, some PostScript interpreters differ in
the commands needed to achieve a particular effect, hence a PostScript file
might have to be adapted for a certain device if it was orginally generated for
a different one. This post-processing of PostScript files is the job of a
PostScript "document manager" or "print manager". It obtains its information
from a PPD (PostScript Printer Description) file for the printer selected.

The most useful kind of document manager is a preprocessor for a spooler. This
preprocessor parses the PostScript file to determine its current settings, asks
the user which special features (e.g., duplex printing, output quality,
stapling, etc.) are desired, extends or modifies the file with commands
extracted from the PPD file, and passes the modified file to the spooler.

There exist also spooler-integrated document managers where the user interface
is detached from the editing component; in these cases the interface passes the
information it has collected to the spooling interface in some spooler-specific
manner and later a backend inserts appropriate PostScript commands.

Primitive document manager implementations don't bother about parsing the
PostScript file but merely prepend the new PostScript commands to the file;
such commands will not take effect if the file already contains invocations of
the same feature. Beware of this in particular in the case of Windows-generated
PostScript files which usually contain explicit settings for the resolution.
You might consider adding definitions for ghostscript's FIXEDRESOLUTION
variable to the *Resolution statements in the PPD file if you have such a
document manager.

PPD files contain also some information which is relevant for software
generating PostScript files. A case in point is the list of supported media
sizes: it can be used by PostScript-generating programs to present a user with
a list of choices for the document to be composed, and it is also used by the
document manager to replace the size's invocation code with the commands
required to obtain this size on the printer selected. It can be confusing if
you have a PPD-based user interface to a print system which accepts PostScript
as well as non-PostScript files and where the interface does not clearly
distinguish between these two steps (document composition and printing); you
might get the impression that you can alter the page size after the PostScript
file has been generated. (A similar case is page orientation.) Actually,
PostScript does provide functionality for doing this (PageSize recovery
policies), but altering the size selection commands is logically wrong and does
not give a usable result in general.

The PPD file format is defined by Adobe:

      Adobe Systems Incorporated
      "PostScript Printer Description File Format Specification"
      Version 4.3
      9 February 1996
      Document ID: PN LPS5003

This specification can be obtained from http://www.adobe.com.



The PPD Files for pcl3
**********************
The PPD files distributed with pcl3 are not complete descriptions of the
devices implemented by ghostscript with the pcl3 driver. Their main purpose is
to provide some essential support for document managers acting as
preprocessors. This makes it possible to create printing interfaces which are
easier to use than ghostscript's command line interface. As a consequence,
you will find no *OpenUI/*CloseUI entries for device parameters like
"SendBlackLast" or "PJLLanguage": the values of these parameters are not
job-specific but printer-specific properties and should be given as additions
in other PPD statements or in the call to ghostscript.

PPD files can include other PPD files. For pcl3, the include structure looks
like this (inclusion is from top to bottom):

	gs-pcl3-<subdevice>.ppd
	|
	gs-pcl3-common.ppd
	|
	gs.ppd
	|
	gs-<gs version>.ppd
	|
	gs-common.ppd

Several of the files gs-pcl3-<subdevice>.ppd and in particular those where
<subdevice> is not an acceptable argument to "-sSubdevice" are valid for
several subdevices. If you are unsure which file to select, check the initial
comments or the *ModelName statement in a file to discover the subdevices
supported by that file.

The gs-pcl3-<subdevice>.ppd files assume that the PostScript file generated by
the document manager is passed to a ghostscript executable with options
selecting pcl3 and the intended subdevice and without altering the default
state of the device as far as it is reflected in the PPD file. If this does not
agree with your environment, use a local PPD customization file for the
necessary adaptations.

If you're using CUPS, device and subdevice selection should happen via the
*cupsFilter statement and the filter called. The gs-pcl3-<subdevice>.ppd files
already contain *cupsFilter statements using the cups-pcl3 filter. If you're
using a different filter, modify the statements as needed, otherwise read the
initial comments in the file cups-pcl3.


Installation of the Files
*************************

1.  Create a file called gs.ppd for describing site-specific settings of your
    ghostscript installation. It should contain at least the following
    statements:

      *PPD-Adobe: "4.3"
      *DefaultPaperDimension: <size>
      *Include: "gs-<gs version>.ppd"

    Replace "<size>" with the default page size configured for your ghostscript
    installation. Usually, this is either "A4" or "Letter". In the case of A4
    you would therefore write:

      *DefaultPaperDimension: A4

    You might also wish to insert other statements here which describe settings
    which are relevant for a document manager. For example, if your document
    manager downloads fonts to the PostScript interpreter if it is of the
    opinion that the latter does not have a particular font used in a document
    (this is the case for CUPS), you should compose a PPD file with a list of
    fonts accessible to your ghostscript installation and insert it or an
    *Include statement for it at this point. You can use the fonts.ppd file in
    this directory as a model (or as a temporary substitute); it contains a
    list of ghostscript's usual standard fonts. If the programs accessing the
    PPD file use it only for determining whether a font is accessible to the
    interpreter or not, you can also simply use the list of font descriptions
    resulting from running gs on:

      /scratch 200 string def
      (*)
      {
	(*Font ) print print (: Standard "\(0.0\)" Standard Disk\n) print
      }
      scratch /Font resourceforall

    (put this into a file and run "gs -q -dBATCH -sDEVICE=bit" on it). This
    output will contain information which is wrong, but it will list all fonts
    known to your ghostscript installation.

    Don't forget to also replace <gs version> with your ghostscript's version
    number. If there is no gs-<gs version>.ppd file for your gs version, use
    one of the existing gs-<gs version>.ppd files as a model.

2.  The PPD specification distinguishes between printer models (e.g., the
    HP DeskJet 540) and printer instances (e.g., the second printer in
    room 12). The PPD file for an instance can be generated by creating a local
    instance-specific customization file which includes the model's PPD file.

    If your document manager has an interface for instance installation, it is
    sufficient to give it the relevant gs-pcl3-<subdevice>.ppd files which
    describe models. Otherwise you usually have to create a customization file
    under the name of the instance, containing just

      *PPD-Adobe: "4.3"
      *ShortNickName: "<short text>"
      *NickName: "<text>"
      *Include: "gs-pcl3-<subdevice>.ppd"

    with <text> describing the printer instance (<short text> should basically
    have the same content but consist of at most 31 characters) and <subdevice>
    being replaced to generate the name of the pcl3 PPD file you wish to use
    for this printer.

    If you wish to extend or override other settings in the
    gs-pcl3-<subdevice>.ppd file, add these statements in the customization
    file between the first and the last statement above.

    The pcl3 PPD files contain *InputSlot definitions only for those media
    sources ("Cassette" and "ManualFeed") which are available independent of
    your "InputAttributes" definitions. If you configure a print queue such
    that other sources are available as well, read the comments on the
    *InputSlot entry in gs-pcl3-common.ppd.

    You can't use local customization files with CUPS up to at least version
    1.1.8 because the CUPS PPD scanner (a) does not support the *Include
    statement and (b) violates the PPD specification in either taking the
    last occurrence of a keyword as the correct instance or collecting all
    instances instead of disregarding every except the first. Modify the
    installed instance files in this case if you need some customization, for
    example to change the "*NickName" value (which actually CUPS should do when
    you give it a description for the print queue at creation time).

3.  Copy all PPD files needed into a directory where they will be found by your
    document manager.

    If your document manager does not support the "*Include" statement, use the
    script "catppd" for this purpose:

	catppd <top PPD file> <target directory or file>

    The script requires that all the files referenced from <top PPD file> must
    be accessible from the current working directory under the name given in
    the "*Include" statement. In the case of pcl3's PPD files this means that
    you must call it from the "ppd" directory. If you are installing model
    files you may specify any gs-pcl3-*.ppd file for <top PPD file> with the
    exception of gs-pcl3-common.ppd. If you are installing instance files, use
    catppd only on your customization files.

    For CUPS up to at least version 1.1.8 you'll have to use catppd and you
    should copy the files into the .../cups/model directory. You must also
    remove the second "*OpenUI *MediaType: ... *CloseUI *MediaType" section
    from the copied gs-pcl3-unspec.ppd file.

4.  If you are using the "unspec" or "unspecold" subdevices, check whether the
    PPD file supports all the features you need. You will also almost certainly
    find some features or values there which are not supported by your printer.
    It is probably best to create your own PPD file in this case.

INTRODUCTION

CUPS(tm) is provided under the GNU General Public License ("GPL")
and GNU Library General Public License ("LGPL"), Version 2, with
exceptions for Apple operating systems and the OpenSSL toolkit. A
copy of the exceptions and licenses follow this introduction.

The GNU LGPL applies to the CUPS and CUPS Imaging libraries
located in the "cups" and "filter" subdirectories of the CUPS
source distribution and the files in the "test" subdirectory. The
GNU GPL applies to the remainder of the CUPS distribution.

For those not familiar with the GNU GPL, the license basically
allows you to:

   - Use the CUPS software at no charge.
   - Distribute verbatim copies of the software in source or
     binary form.
   - Sell verbatim copies of the software for a media fee, or
     sell support for the software.

What this license *does not* allow you to do is make changes or
add features to CUPS and then sell a binary distribution without
source code. You must provide source for any changes or additions
to the software, and all code must be provided under the GPL or
LGPL as appropriate. The only exceptions to this are the portions
of the CUPS software covered by the Apple operating system
license exceptions outlined later in this license agreement.

The GNU LGPL relaxes the "link-to" restriction, allowing you to
develop applications that use the CUPS and CUPS Imaging libraries
under other licenses and/or conditions as appropriate for your
application, driver, or filter.


LICENSE EXCEPTIONS

In addition, as the copyright holder of CUPS, Apple Inc. grants
the following special exceptions:

     1. Apple Operating System Development License Exception;

	   third party printer drivers, filters, and backends
	   for an Apple Operating System, that is linked to the
	   CUPS imaging library or based on any sample filters
	   or backends provided with CUPS shall not be
	   considered to be a derivative work or collective work
	   based on the CUPS program and is exempt from the
	   mandatory source code release clauses of the GNU GPL.
	   You may therefore distribute linked combinations of
	   the CUPS imaging library with Apple OS-Developed
	   Software without releasing the source code of the
	   Apple OS-Developed Software. You may also use sample
	   filters and backends provided with CUPS to develop
	   Apple OS-Developed Software without releasing the

	c. This exception is only available for Apple
	   OS-Developed Software and does not apply to software
	   that is distributed for use on other operating
	   systems.

	d. All CUPS software that falls under this license
	   exception have the following text at the top of each
	   source file:

	     This file is subject to the Apple OS-Developed

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                       59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
			 Version 2, June 1991

	  Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
       59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

    [This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
   numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

			       Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
your libraries, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
the original authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
free use or not licensed at all.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
the same as in the ordinary license.

  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
treats it as such.

  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.

  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
will lead to faster development of free libraries.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
works together with the library.

  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
General Public License rather than by this special one.

		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING

FREETYPE LICENSES
-----------------

The FreeType  2 font  engine is  copyrighted work  and cannot  be used
legally without  a software  license.  In order  to make  this project
usable to  a vast majority of  developers, we distribute it  under two
mutually exclusive open-source licenses.

This means that *you* must choose  *one* of the two licenses described
below, then obey all its terms and conditions when using FreeType 2 in
any of your projects or products.

  - The FreeType License,  found in the file  `docs/FTL.TXT`, which is
    similar to the  original BSD license *with*  an advertising clause
    that forces  you to explicitly  cite the FreeType project  in your
    product's  documentation.  All  details are  in the  license file.
    This license is suited to products which don't use the GNU General
    Public License.

    Note that  this license  is compatible to  the GNU  General Public
    License version 3, but not version 2.

  - The   GNU   General   Public   License   version   2,   found   in
    `docs/GPLv2.TXT`  (any  later  version  can  be  used  also),  for
    programs  which  already  use  the  GPL.  Note  that  the  FTL  is
    incompatible with GPLv2 due to its advertisement clause.

The contributed  BDF and PCF  drivers come  with a license  similar to
that  of the  X Window  System.   It is  compatible to  the above  two
licenses (see files `src/bdf/README`  and `src/pcf/README`).  The same
holds   for   the   source    code   files   `src/base/fthash.c`   and
`include/freetype/internal/fthash.h`; they were part of the BDF driver
in earlier FreeType versions.

The gzip  module uses the  zlib license (see  `src/gzip/zlib.h`) which
too is compatible to the above two licenses.

The files `src/autofit/ft-hb.c` and `src/autofit/ft-hb.h` contain code
taken almost  verbatim from the  HarfBuzz file `hb-ft.cc`,  which uses
the 'Old MIT' license, compatible to the above two licenses.

The  MD5 checksum  support  (only used  for  debugging in  development
builds) is in the public domain.

FreeType 2.13.0
===============

Homepage: https://www.freetype.org

FreeType is a freely available software library to render fonts.

It  is  written  in  C,   designed  to  be  small,  efficient,  highly
customizable,  and portable  while capable  of producing  high-quality
output (glyph images) of most vector and bitmap font formats.

Please   read  the   `docs/CHANGES`   file,   it  contains   IMPORTANT
INFORMATION.

Read the files `docs/INSTALL*`  for installation instructions; see the
file `docs/LICENSE.TXT` for the available licenses.

For using FreeType's git repository  instead of a distribution bundle,
please read file  `README.git`.  Note that you have  to actually clone
the repository; using a snapshot will  not work (in other words, don't
use gitlab's 'Download' button).

The FreeType 2 API reference is located in directory `docs/reference`;
use the file  `index.html` as the top entry point.   [Please note that
currently  the search  function  for  locally installed  documentation
doesn't work due to cross-site scripting issues.]

Additional documentation is  available as a separate  package from our
sites.  Go to

  https://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/freetype/

and download one of the following files.

  freetype-doc-2.13.0.tar.xz

The makefile.os4 is for the AmigaOS4 SDK.  To use it, type
"make -f makefile.os4", it produces a link library libft2_ppc.a.

The makefile is for ppc-morphos-gcc-2.95.3-bin.tgz (gcc 2.95.3 hosted on
68k-Amiga producing MorphOS-PPC-binaries from http://www.morphos.de).
To use it, type "make assign", then "make"; it produces a link library
libft2_ppc.a.

The smakefile is a makefile for Amiga SAS/C 6.58 (no longer available,
latest sold version was 6.50, updates can be found in Aminet).  It is
based on the version found in the sourcecode of ttf.library 0.83b for
FreeType 1.3.1 from Richard Griffith (ragriffi@sprynet.com,
http://ragriffi.home.sprynet.com).

You will also need the latest include files and amiga.lib from the
Amiga web site (https://os.amigaworld.de/download.php?id=3) for
AmigaOS 3.9; the generated code should work under AmigaOS 2.04 and up.

To use it, call "smake assign" and then "smake" from the builds/amiga
directory.  The results are:

- A link library "ft2_680x0.lib" (where x depends on the setting of
  the CPU entry in the smakefile) containing all FreeType2 parts
  except of the init code, debugging code, and the system interface
  code.

- ftsystem.o, an object module containing the standard version of the
  system interface code which uses fopen() fclose() fread() fseek()
  ftell() malloc() realloc() and free() from lib:sc.lib (not pure).

- ftsystempure.o, an object module containing the pure version of the
  system interface code which uses Open() Close() Read() Seek()
  ExamineFH() AsmAllocPooled() AsmFreePooled() etc.  This version can
  be used in both normal programs and in Amiga run-time shared system
  librarys (can be linked with lib:libinit.o, no copying of DATA and
  BSS hunks for each OpenLibrary() necessary).  Source code is in
  src/base/ftsystem.c.

- ftdebug.o, an object module containing the standard version of the
  debugging code which uses vprintf() and exit() (not pure).
  Debugging can be turned on in FT:include/freetype/config/ftoption.h
  and with FT_SetTraceLevel().

- ftdebugpure.o, an object module containing the pure version of the
  debugging code which uses KVPrintf() from lib:debug.lib and no
  exit().  For debugging of Amiga run-time shared system libraries.
  Source code is in src/base/ftdebug.c.

- NO ftinit.o.  Because linking with a link library should result in
  linking only the needed object modules in it, but standard
  ftsystem.o would force ALL FreeType2 modules to be linked to your
  program, I decided to use a different scheme: You must #include
  FT:src/base/ftinit.c in your sourcecode and specify with #define
  statements which modules you need.  See
  include/freetype/config/ftmodule.h.


To use in your own programs:

- Insert the #define and #include statements from top of
  include/freetype/config/ftmodule.h in your source code and
  uncomment the #define statements for the FreeType2 modules you need.

- You can use either PARAMETERS=REGISTER or PARAMETERS=STACK for
  calling the FreeType2 functions, because the link library and the
  object files are compiled with PARAMETERS=BOTH.

- "smake assign" (assign "FT:" to the FreeType2 main directory).

- Compile your program.

- Link with either ftsystem.o or ftsystempure.o, if debugging enabled
  with either ftdebug.o or (ftdebugpure.o and lib:debug.lib), and with
  ft2_680x0.lib as link library.


To adapt to other compilers:

- The standard ANSI C maximum length of 31 significant characters in
  identifiers is not enough for FreeType2.  Check if your compiler has
  a minimum length of 40 significant characters or can be switched to
  it.  "idlen=40" is the option for SAS/C.  Setting #define
  HAVE_LIMIT_ON_IDENTS in an include file may also work (not tested).

- Make sure that the include directory in builds/amiga is searched
  before the normal FreeType2 include directory, so you are able to
  replace problematic include files with your own version (same may be
  useful for the src directory).

- An example of how to replace/workaround a problematic include file
  is include/freetype/config/ftconfig.h; it changes a #define that
  would prevent SAS/C from generating XDEF's where it should do that and
  then includes the standard FreeType2 include file.

gxvalid: TrueType GX validator
==============================


1. What is this
---------------

  `gxvalid' is a module to  validate TrueType GX tables: a collection of
  additional tables  in TrueType  font which are  used by  `QuickDraw GX
  Text',  Apple Advanced  Typography  (AAT).  In  addition, gxvalid  can
  validates `kern'  tables which have  been extended for AAT.   Like the
  otvalid  module,   gxvalid  uses   FreeType  2's  validator  framework
  (ftvalid).

  You can link gxvalid with your program; before running your own layout
  engine, gxvalid validates a font  file.  As the result, you can remove
  error-checking code  from the layout  engine.  It is also  possible to
  use  gxvalid  as a  stand-alone  font  validator;  the `ftvalid'  test
  program  included  in the  ft2demo  bundle  calls gxvalid  internally.
  A stand-alone font validator may be useful for font developers.

  This documents documents the following issues.

  - supported TrueType GX tables
  - fundamental validation limitations
  - permissive error handling of broken GX tables
  - `kern' table issue.


2. Supported tables
-------------------

  The following GX tables are currently supported.

    bsln
    feat
    just
    kern(*)
    lcar
    mort
    morx
    opbd
    prop
    trak

  The following GX tables are currently unsupported.

    cvar
    fdsc
    fmtx
    fvar
    gvar
    Zapf

  The following GX tables won't be supported.

    acnt(**)
    hsty(***)

  The following undocumented tables in TrueType fonts designed for Apple
  platform aren't handled either.

    addg
    CVTM
    TPNM
    umif


  *)   The `kern'  validator handles both  the classic and the  new kern
       formats;  the former  is supported  on both  Microsoft  and Apple
       platforms, while the latter is supported on Apple platforms.

  **)  `acnt' tables are not supported by currently available Apple font
       tools.

  ***) There  is  one more  Apple  extension,  `hsty',  but  it  is  for
       Newton-OS, not GX  (Newton-OS is a platform by  Apple, but it can
       use  sfnt- housed bitmap  fonts only).   Therefore, it  should be
       excluded  from  `Apple  platform'  in the  context  of  TrueType.
       gxvalid ignores it as Apple font tools do so.


  We have  checked 183  fonts bundled with  MacOS 9.1, MacOS  9.2, MacOS
  10.0, MacOS X 10.1, MSIE  for MacOS, and AppleWorks 6.0.  In addition,
  we have  checked 67 Dynalab fonts  (designed for MacOS)  and 189 Ricoh
  fonts (designed for Windows and  MacOS dual platforms).  The number of
  fonts including TrueType GX tables are as follows.

    bsln:  76
    feat: 191
    just:  84
    kern:  59
    lcar:   4
    mort: 326
    morx:  19
    opbd:   4
    prop: 114
    trak:  16

  Dynalab  and Ricoh fonts  don't have  GX tables  except of  `feat' and
  `mort'.


3. Fundamental validation limitations
-------------------------------------

  TrueType  GX  provides  layout   information  to  libraries  for  font
  rasterizers  and text layout.   gxvalid can  check whether  the layout
  data in  a font is conformant  to the TrueType GX  format specified by
  Apple.  But gxvalid cannot check  a how QuickDraw GX/AAT renderer uses
  the stored information.

  3-1. Validation of State Machine activity
  -----------------------------------------

    QuickDraw GX/AAT uses a `State Machine' to provide `stateful' layout
    features,  and TrueType GX  stores the  state transition  diagram of
    this `State  Machine' in a  `StateTable' data structure.   While the
    State  Machine receives  a series  of glyph  IDs, the  State Machine
    starts with `start  of text' state, walks around  various states and
    generates various  layout information  to the  renderer, and finally
    reaches the `end of text' state.

    gxvalid can check essential errors like:

      - possibility of state transitions to undefined states
      - existence of glyph  IDs that the State Machine  doesn't know how
        to handle
      - the  State Machine  cannot compute  the layout  information from
        given diagram

    These errors  can be  checked within finite  steps, and  without the
    State Machine itself, because these are `expression' errors of state
    transition diagram.

    There  is no  limitation  about  how long  the  State Machine  walks
    around,  so validation  of  the algorithm  in  the state  transition
    diagram requires infinite  steps, even if we had  a State Machine in
    gxvalid.   Therefore, the  following errors  and problems  cannot be
    checked.

      - existence of states which the State Machine never transits to
      - the  possibility that the  State Machine  never reaches  `end of
        text'
      - the possibility of stack underflow/overflow in the State Machine
        (in  ligature  and  contextual  glyph substitutions,  the  State
        Machine can store 16 glyphs onto its stack)

    In addition, gxvalid doesn't check `temporary glyph IDs' used in the
    chained State Machines  (in `mort' and `morx' tables).   If a layout
    feature  is  implemented by  a  single  State  Machine, a  glyph  ID
    converted by the State Machine is passed to the glyph renderer, thus
    it  should not  point to  an undefined  glyph ID.   But if  a layout
    feature is implemented by  chained State Machines, a component State
    Machine  (if it  is  not the  final  one) is  permitted to  generate
    undefined glyph IDs for temporary use, because it is handled by next
    component State Machine and not  by the glyph renderer.  To validate
    such temporary glyph IDs, gxvalid must stack all undefined glyph IDs
    which  can occur in  the output  of the  previous State  Machine and
    search  them in  the  `ClassTable' structure  of  the current  State
    Machine.  It is too complex to  list all possible glyph IDs from the
    StateTable, especially from a ligature substitution table.

  3-2. Validation of relationship between multiple layout features
  ----------------------------------------------------------------

    gxvalid does  not validate the relationship  between multiple layout
    features at all.

    If  multiple layout  features  are defined  in  TrueType GX  tables,
    possible  interactions,  overrides,  and  conflicts  between  layout
    features are implicitly  given in the font too.   For example, there
    are several predefined spacing control features:

      - Text Spacing          (Proportional/Monospace/Half-width/Normal)
      - Number Spacing        (Monospaced-numbers/Proportional-numbers)
      - Kana Spacing          (Full-width/Proportional)
      - Ideographic Spacing   (Full-width/Proportional)
      - CJK Roman Spacing     (Half-width/Proportional/Default-roman
                               /Full-width-roman/Proportional)

    If all  layout features are  independently managed, we  can activate
    inconsistent  typographic rules  like  `Text Spacing=Monospace'  and
    `Ideographic Spacing=Proportional' at the same time.

    The combinations  of layout features  is managed by a  32bit integer
    (one bit each for selector  setting), so we can define relationships
    between  up  to 32  features,  theoretically.   But  if one  feature
    setting  affects  another   feature  setting,  we  need  typographic
    priority  rules to  validate the  relationship.   Unfortunately, the
    TrueType GX format specification does not give such information even
    for predefined features.


4. Permissive error handling of broken GX tables
------------------------------------------------

  When  Apple's font  rendering system  finds an  inconsistency,  like a
  specification  violation or  an  unspecified value  in  a TrueType  GX
  table, it does not always  return error.  In most cases, the rendering
  engine silently  ignores such wrong  values or even whole  tables.  In
  fact, MacOS is shipped with  fonts including broken GX/AAT tables, but
  no harmful  effects due to  `officially broken' fonts are  observed by
  end-users.

  gxvalid  is designed  to continue  the validation  process as  long as
  possible.  When gxvalid find wrong  values, gxvalid warns it at least,
  and takes  a fallback procedure  if possible.  The  fallback procedure
  depends on the debug level.

  We used the following three tools to investigate Apple's error handling.

    - FontValidator  (for MacOS 8.5 - 9.2)  resource fork font
    - ftxvalidator   (for MacOS X 10.1 -)   dfont or naked-sfnt
    - ftxdumperfuser (for MacOS X 10.1 -)   dfont or naked-sfnt

  However, all tests were done on a PowerPC based Macintosh; at present,
  we have not checked those tools on a m68k-based Macintosh.

  In total, we checked 183 fonts  bundled to MacOS 9.1, MacOS 9.2, MacOS
  10.0, MacOS X  10.1, MSIE for MacOS, and  AppleWorks 6.0.  These fonts
  are distributed  officially, but many broken GX/AAT  tables were found
  by Apple's font tools.  In the following, we list typical violation of
  the GX specification, in fonts officially distributed with those Apple
  systems.

  4-1. broken BinSrchHeader (19/183)
  ----------------------------------

    `BinSrchHeader' is  a header of a  data array for  m68k platforms to
    access memory efficiently.  Although  there are only two independent
    parameters  for real  (`unitSize' and  `nUnits'),  BinSrchHeader has
    three additional parameters which  can be calculated from `unitSize'
    and  `nUnits',  for  fast  setup.   Apple  font  tools  ignore  them
    silently, so gxvalid warns if it finds and inconsistency, and always
    continues  validation.    The  additional  parameters   are  ignored
    regardless of the consistency.

      19  fonts include  such  inconsistencies; all  breaks  are in  the
      BinSrchHeader structure of the `kern' table.

  4-2. too-short LookupTable (5/183)
  ----------------------------------

    LookupTable format 0  is a simple array to get a  value from a given
    GID (glyph  ID); the index of  this array is a  GID too.  Therefore,
    the length  of the array is expected  to be same as  the maximum GID
    value defined  in the `maxp' table,  but there are  some fonts whose
    LookupTable format 0 is too  short to cover all GIDs.  FontValidator
    ignores  this error silently,  ftxvalidator and  ftxdumperfuser both
    warn and continue.  Similar problems are found in format 3 subtables
    of `kern'.  gxvalid  warns always and abort if  the validation level
    is set to FT_VALIDATE_PARANOID.

      5 fonts include too-short kern format 0 subtables.
      1 font includes too-short kern format 3 subtable.

  4-3. broken LookupTable format 2 (1/183)
  ----------------------------------------

    LookupTable  format  2,  subformat  4  covers the  GID  space  by  a
    collection  of  segments which  are  specified  by `firstGlyph'  and
    `lastGlyph'.   Some  fonts  store  `firstGlyph' and  `lastGlyph'  in
    reverse order,  so the segment specification is  broken.  Apple font
    tools ignore this error silently;  a broken segment is ignored as if
    it  did not  exist.   gxvalid  warns and  normalize  the segment  at
    FT_VALIDATE_DEFAULT, or ignore  the segment at FT_VALIDATE_TIGHT, or
    abort at FT_VALIDATE_PARANOID.

      1 font includes broken LookupTable format 2, in the `just' table.

    *) It seems  that all fonts manufactured by  ITC for AppleWorks have
       this error.

  4-4. bad bracketing in glyph property (14/183)
  ----------------------------------------------

    GX/AAT defines a  `bracketing' property of the glyphs  in the `prop'
    table,  to control layout  features of  strings enclosed  inside and
    outside  of   brackets.   Some  fonts   give  inappropriate  bracket
    properties  to glyphs.   Apple  font tools  warn  about this  error;
    gxvalid warns too and aborts at FT_VALIDATE_PARANOID.

      14 fonts include wrong bracket properties.


  4-5. invalid feature number (117/183)
  -------------------------------------

    The GX/AAT  extension can  include 255 different  layout features,
    but    popular    layout     features    are    predefined    (see
    https://developer.apple.com/fonts/TrueType-Reference-Manual/RM09/AppendixF.html).
    Some fonts include feature numbers which are incompatible with the
    predefined feature registry.

    In our survey, there are 140 fonts including `feat' table.

    a) 67 fonts use a feature number which should not be used.
    b) 117 fonts set the wrong feature range (nSetting).  This is mostly
       found in the `mort' and `morx' tables.

    Apple  font tools give  no warning,  although they  cannot recognize
    what  the feature  is.   At FT_VALIDATE_DEFAULT,  gxvalid warns  but
    continues in both cases (a, b).  At FT_VALIDATE_TIGHT, gxvalid warns
    and aborts for (a), but continues for (b).  At FT_VALIDATE_PARANOID,
    gxvalid warns and aborts in both cases (a, b).

  4-6. invalid prop version (10/183)
  ----------------------------------

    As most TrueType GX tables, the `prop' table must start with a 32bit
    version identifier: 0x00010000,  0x00020000 or 0x00030000.  But some
    fonts  store nonsense binary  data instead.   When Apple  font tools
    find them, they abort the processing immediately, and the data which
    follows is unhandled.  gxvalid does the same.

      10 fonts include broken `prop' version.

    All  of these  fonts are  classic  TrueType fonts  for the  Japanese
    script, manufactured by Apple.

  4-7. unknown resource name (2/183)
  ------------------------------------

    NOTE: THIS IS NOT A TRUETYPE GX ERROR.

    If  a TrueType  font is  stored  in the  resource fork  or in  dfont
    format, the data must be tagged as `sfnt' in the resource fork index
    to invoke TrueType font handler for the data.  But the TrueType font
    data  in   `Keyboard.dfont'  is  tagged   as  `kbd',  and   that  in
    `LastResort.dfont' is tagged as  `lst'.  Apple font tools can detect
    that the data is in  TrueType format and successfully validate them.
    Maybe  this is possible  because they  are known  to be  dfont.  The
    current  implementation  of the  resource  fork  driver of  FreeType
    cannot do that, thus gxvalid cannot validate them.

      2 fonts use an unknown tag for the TrueType font resource.

5. `kern' table issues
----------------------

  In common terminology of TrueType, `kern' is classified as a basic and
  platform-independent table.  But there are Apple extensions of `kern',
  and  there is  an  extension which  requires  a GX  state machine  for
  contextual kerning.   Therefore, gxvalid includes  a special validator
  for  `kern' tables.   Unfortunately, there  is no  exact  algorithm to
  check Apple's extension, so  gxvalid includes a heuristic algorithm to
  find  the proper validation  routines for  all possible  data formats,
  including    the   data    format   for    Microsoft.     By   calling
  classic_kern_validate() instead of gxv_validate(), you can specify the
  `kern' format  explicitly.  However, current  FreeType2 uses Microsoft
  `kern' format  only, others  are ignored (and  should be handled  in a
  library one level higher than FreeType).

  5-1. History
  ------------

    The original  16bit version of `kern'  was designed by  Apple in the
    pre-GX  era, and  it was  also approved  by  Microsoft.  Afterwards,
    Apple designed a  new 32bit version of the  `kern' table.  According
    to  the documentation, the  difference between  the 16bit  and 32bit
    version is only the size of  variables in the `kern' header.  In the
    following,  we call  the original  16bit version  as  `classic', and
    32bit version as `new'.

  5-2. Versions and dialects which should be differentiated
  ---------------------------------------------------------

    The `kern' table  consists of a table header  and several subtables.
    The version number  which identifies a `classic' or  a `new' version
    is  explicitly   written  in  the   table  header,  but   there  are
    undocumented  differences between  Microsoft's and  Apple's formats.
    It is  called a `dialect' in  the following.  There  are three cases
    which  should  be  handled:   the  new  Apple-dialect,  the  classic
    Apple-dialect,  and the classic  Microsoft-dialect.  An  analysis of
    the formats and the auto detection algorithm of gxvalid is described
    in the following.

    5-2-1. Version detection: classic and new kern
    ----------------------------------------------

      According  to Apple  TrueType  specification, there  are only  two
      differences between the classic and the new:

        - The `kern' table header starts with the version number.
          The classic version starts with 0x0000 (16bit),
          the new version starts with 0x00010000 (32bit).

        - In the  `kern' table header,  the number of  subtables follows
          the version number.
          In the classic version, it is stored as a 16bit value.
          In the new version, it is stored as a 32bit value.

      From Apple font tool's output (DumpKERN is also tested in addition
      to  the  three  Apple  font  tools in  above),  there  is  another
      undocumented difference.  In the  new version, the subtable header
      includes a 16bit variable  named `tupleIndex' which does not exist
      in the classic version.

      The new version  can store all subtable formats (0,  1, 2, and 3),
      but the Apple TrueType specification does not mention the subtable
      formats available in the classic version.

    5-2-2. Available subtable formats in classic version
    ----------------------------------------------------

      Although the  Apple TrueType  specification recommends to  use the
      classic version in  the case if the font is  designed for both the
      Apple and Microsoft platforms,  it does not document the available
      subtable formats in the classic version.

      According  to the Microsoft  TrueType specification,  the subtable
      format  assured for  Windows  and OS/2  support  is only  subtable
      format  0.  The  Microsoft TrueType  specification  also describes
      subtable format  2, but does  not mention which  platforms support
      it.  Subtable formats 1, 3,  and higher are documented as reserved
      for future use.  Therefore, the classic version can store subtable
      formats 0 and 2, at least.  `ttfdump.exe', a font tool provided by
      Microsoft,  ignores the  subtable format  written in  the subtable
      header, and parses the table as if all subtables are in format 0.

      `kern'  subtable format  1  uses  a StateTable,  so  it cannot  be
      utilized without a GX  State Machine.  Therefore, it is reasonable
      to assume  that format 1 (and  3) were introduced  after Apple had
      introduced GX and moved to the new 32bit version.

    5-2-3. Apple and Microsoft dialects
    -----------------------------------

      The  `kern' subtable  has  a 16bit  `coverage'  field to  describe
      kerning attributes, but bit interpretations by Apple and Microsoft
      are different:  For example, Apple  uses bits 0-7 to  identify the
      subtable, while Microsoft uses bits 8-15.

      In  addition, due  to the  output of  DumpKERN  and FontValidator,
      Apple's bit interpretations of coverage in classic and new version
      are  incompatible also.   In  summary, there  are three  dialects:
      classic Apple  dialect, classic  Microsoft dialect, and  new Apple
      dialect.  The classic Microsoft  dialect and the new Apple dialect
      are documented  by each vendors' TrueType  font specification, but
      the documentation for classic Apple dialect is not available.

      For example,  in the  new Apple dialect,  bit 15 is  documented as
      `set to  1 if  the kerning  is vertical'.  On  the other  hand, in
      classic Microsoft dialect, bit 1 is documented as `set to 1 if the
      kerning  is  horizontal'.   From   the  outputs  of  DumpKERN  and
      FontValidator, classic  Apple dialect recognizes  15 as `set  to 1
      when  the kerning  is horizontal'.   From the  results  of similar
      experiments, classic Apple dialect  seems to be the Endian reverse
      of the classic Microsoft dialect.

      As a  conclusion it must be  noted that no font  tool can identify
      classic Apple dialect or classic Microsoft dialect automatically.

    5-2-4. gxvalid auto dialect detection algorithm
    -----------------------------------------------

      The first 16  bits of the `kern' table are  enough to identify the
      version:

        - if  the first  16  bits are  0x0000,  the `kern'  table is  in
          classic Apple dialect or classic Microsoft dialect
        - if the first 16 bits are  0x0001, and next 16 bits are 0x0000,
          the kern table is in new Apple dialect.

      If the `kern'  table is a classic one,  the 16bit `coverage' field
      is checked next.   Firstly, the coverage bits are  decoded for the
      classic Apple dialect using the following bit masks (this is based
      on DumpKERN output):

        0x8000: 1=horizontal, 0=vertical
        0x4000: not used
        0x2000: 1=cross-stream, 0=normal
        0x1FF0: reserved
        0x000F: subtable format

      If  any  of  reserved  bits  are  set  or  the  subtable  bits  is
      interpreted as format 1 or 3, we take it as `impossible in classic
      Apple dialect' and retry, using the classic Microsoft dialect.

        The most popular coverage in new Apple-dialect:         0x8000,
        The most popular coverage in classic Apple-dialect:     0x0000,
        The most popular coverage in classic Microsoft dialect: 0x0001.

  5-3. Tested fonts
  -----------------

    We checked  59 fonts  bundled with MacOS  and 38 fonts  bundled with
    Windows, where all font include a `kern' table.

      - fonts bundled with MacOS
        * new Apple dialect
          format 0: 18
          format 2:  1
          format 3:  1
        * classic Apple dialect
          format 0: 14
        * classic Microsoft dialect
          format 0: 15

      - fonts bundled with Windows
        * classic Microsoft dialect
          format 0: 38

    It looks strange that classic Microsoft-dialect fonts are bundled to
    MacOS: they come from MSIE for MacOS, except of MarkerFelt.dfont.

IJS 0.35

News as of 0.35:
11 Feb 2004

The autoconf build system has been moderized and we now use 
libtool for portable shared library building. Thanks to Roger
Leigh for helping with that.

Also a bug with ColorSpace field was corrected, thanks to David 
Suffield.

News as of 0.34:
22 Apr 2002

The source files now have official MIT license banners. Thanks to
www.opensource.org for hosting the ur-text of this license. Also
some clarifications on namespace management in the spec.

There is now an IJS website, graciously hosted by linuxprinting.org.
http://www.linuxprinting.org/ijs/

There have been some minor improvements in the makefile.

News as of 0.33:

The buffer size has been increased to 4096. It should probably be
dynamically allocated, though. Minor clarification in BitsPerSample
language in spec (thanks to Jackie Chang for pointing out the
ambiguity).

News as of 0.32:

The xres and yres fields of ph are now floats.

The example server now supports margins. A few small bugs have
been cleaned up as well.

News as of 0.31:

A number of small cleanups in the code. The example client and server
support more querying and enumeration, but not yet margins.

There is a new API for the client to query the negotiated version
number.

The ijs_exec_unix module now sets the SIGPIPE signal to ignore. This
way, if the client abnormally exits, it allows the error to propagate
through the read() or write() call to the pipe, rather than
immediately killing the client.

News as of 0.30:

It now builds as a library. Also, there is basic autoconf support (but
not automake or libtool). It's probably best to link the static
library for now. I'm open to suggestions - I'm open to drinking the
entire pitcher of auto* Kool-Aid, but we probably won't use libtool
in Ghostscript builds.

This release fixes a number of bugs and improves portability. In
particular, server errors should now bubble up to the client, and
the termination logic has been patched according to David Suffield,
who discovered a race condition there. Thanks to David and Russell
for patches.

The spec is now in a reasonable draft. See ijs_spec.sgml and
ijs_spec.pdf. Comments and suggestions are welcome.

The example client and server have _not_ yet been updated to use
the newer features of the ijs spec. Patches are welcome.

News as of 0.29:

I've added a number of things discussed on the mailing list, including
listing and enumerating parameters, as well as a job abstraction.
The client interface has changed a bit - job id's are now present
in most callbacks, colorspace is now presented only as a string, and
there are quite a few more callbacks.

I've started a skeleton of a protocol spec in DocBook.

Note, there's a potential race condition in EXIT noted by David
Suffield. The fix hasn't yet been merged in from his work.

News as of 0.2:

This version integrates set_param and get_param, and has moved the
"page header" processing to use set_param.

Also, there are both Windows (MS VC++) and Unix makefiles. Use
"make -f unix.mak" to build on Unix. Thanks to Russell Lang for
Windows portability work.


Introduction

This is an early snapshot of IJS. I expect the protocols and API's to
evolve somewhat, and things like error handling are still far from
perfect. However, I'm pretty happy that this is going in the right
direction.

I am doing this prerelease so that authors of various packages related
to raster-based printing can start thinking about how to integrate it.
Ideally, all producers of printable raster data should be able to
function as an ijs client, and all consumers should be able to
function as an ijs server. This release is about as functional as
piping pnm's, which is primitive, but the way a lot of drivers still
work.


What is IJS?

IJS is, first and foremost, a protocol for transmission of raster page
images. This snapshot provides a reference implementation of the
protocol, the design of which is still in flux. When the protocol
specification is published, it will be authoritative. Applications
should feel free to link against the library provided in this package,
adapt that code for their own needs, or roll a completely new
implementation.

The protocol is a fairly traditional client-server design. In general,
the client sends one or more page images to the server, along with
various metadata. Communication is through simple "commands", which
are essentially size-prefixed packets. The client sends a command to
the server, then waits for a response command, either ACK or NAK.

The server "speaks" IJS through stdin and stdout. One consequence of
this design decision is that the server can be invoked remotely, for
example through ssh. It's not clear yet how useful this will be, but
at least people can experiment with it.

Currently, all data goes through the stdin and stdout pipes. It is
envisioned that a shared memory transport will also be provided,
transparently. IJS will fall back to pipes if shared memory is not
available for any reason.

I'm not yet convinced that the performance win for shared memory is
significant. I would like to benchmark domain sockets as well, as they
are likely to provide better performance than pipes, and are also
highly desirable for cases where the server runs as a persistent
daemon.

This tarball provides an "IJS library" in the form of ijs, ijs_client,
and ijs_server. It also provides an example client (capable of reading
pnmraw files) and an example server (capable of generating
PostScript). I imagine that the example programs will be useful for
development and testing, but that end-users probably won't find a need
for them.

To try IJS, compile and run "./ijs_client_example -s
./ijs_server_example -pOutputFile=/tmp/tmp.ps foo.ppm". This will
invoke ./ijs_server_example, which will in turn generate a /tmp/tmp.ps
file.

The ijs_client_example takes a -p command line argument for setting
parameters, and a -r argument for setting resolution.  Here is a
typical command line:

./ijs_client_example -s ./ijs_server_example -pOutputFile=/tmp/tmp.ps \
  -r300 in.ppm

The syntax of -p is a sequence of key=value pairs, separated by
commas.  A backslash in the value escapes the next character (allowing
embedded commas in the value). Thus, '-pfoo=bar, quux=a\,b' sets the
key "foo" to the value "bar, and the key "quux" to the value "a,b".


FAQ

What does IJS stand for?

It stands for "raster printer driver architecture." It's spelled
U+30EA U+13DA, to avoid confusion, and to save space in UTF-16
encodings.

Actually, the name derives from HPIJS, which presumably stands for HP
InkJet Server. The name pays homage to HPIJS for the inspiration,
while communicating that it's not specific to HP printers.

Licensing

All source code in this distribution is released under the MIT
License. I want everybody to be able to use this.


More stuff to write:

Actual specification for the protocol (in draft).

Client spawns server, invoker invokes client and server, and
persistent server daemon modes.

Negotation of extensions (goal is interoperability between versions).
(Actually, the PING/PONG protocol as it exists negotiates version
numbers).

TODO:

Shared memory transport.

Should have an alternate mode in which the client is passed the pipe
information, rather than having to spawn the server.

wait() cleanup of invoked server.

Package library up as libijs.a, .so (partially done)

OVERVIEW
========

This package contains C software to implement JPEG image encoding, decoding,
and transcoding.  JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized compression
method for full-color and grayscale images.

This software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive
compression processes.  Provision is made for supporting all variants of these
processes, although some uncommon parameter settings aren't implemented yet.
We have made no provision for supporting the hierarchical or lossless
processes defined in the standard.

We provide a set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG image files,
plus two sample applications "cjpeg" and "djpeg", which use the library to
perform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file formats.
The library is intended to be reused in other applications.

In order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have included
considerable functionality beyond the bare JPEG coding/decoding capability;
for example, the color quantization modules are not strictly part of JPEG
decoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped file formats or
colormapped displays.  These extra functions can be compiled out of the
library if not required for a particular application.

We have also included "jpegtran", a utility for lossless transcoding between
different JPEG processes, and "rdjpgcom" and "wrjpgcom", two simple
applications for inserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files.

The emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving portability and
flexibility, while also making it fast enough to be useful.  In particular,
the software is not intended to be read as a tutorial on JPEG.  (See the
REFERENCES section for introductory material.)  Rather, it is intended to
be reliable, portable, industrial-strength code.  We do not claim to have
achieved that goal in every aspect of the software, but we strive for it.

We welcome the use of this software as a component of commercial products.
No royalty is required, but we do ask for an acknowledgement in product
documentation, as described under LEGAL ISSUES.

REFERENCES
==========

We recommend reading one or more of these references before trying to
understand the innards of the JPEG software.

The best short technical introduction to the JPEG compression algorithm is
	Wallace, Gregory K.  "The JPEG Still Picture Compression Standard",
	Communications of the ACM, April 1991 (vol. 34 no. 4), pp. 30-44.
(Adjacent articles in that issue discuss MPEG motion picture compression,
applications of JPEG, and related topics.)  If you don't have the CACM issue
handy, a PDF file containing a revised version of Wallace's article is
available at https://www.ijg.org/files/Wallace.JPEG.pdf.  The file (actually
a preprint for an article that appeared in IEEE Trans. Consumer Electronics)
omits the sample images that appeared in CACM, but it includes corrections
and some added material.  Note: the Wallace article is copyright ACM and IEEE,
and it may not be used for commercial purposes.

A somewhat less technical, more leisurely introduction to JPEG can be found in
"The Data Compression Book" by Mark Nelson and Jean-loup Gailly, published by
M&T Books (New York), 2nd ed. 1996, ISBN 1-55851-434-1.  This book provides
good explanations and example C code for a multitude of compression methods
including JPEG.  It is an excellent source if you are comfortable reading C
code but don't know much about data compression in general.  The book's JPEG
sample code is far from industrial-strength, but when you are ready to look
at a full implementation, you've got one here...

The best currently available description of JPEG is the textbook "JPEG Still
Image Data Compression Standard" by William B. Pennebaker and Joan L.
Mitchell, published by Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1.
Price US$59.95, 638 pp.  The book includes the complete text of the ISO JPEG
standards (DIS 10918-1 and draft DIS 10918-2).
Although this is by far the most detailed and comprehensive exposition of
JPEG publicly available, we point out that it is still missing an explanation
of the most essential properties and algorithms of the underlying DCT
technology.
If you think that you know about DCT-based JPEG after reading this book,
then you are in delusion.  The real fundamentals and corresponding potential
of DCT-based JPEG are not publicly known so far, and that is the reason for
all the mistaken developments taking place in the image coding domain.

The original JPEG standard is divided into two parts, Part 1 being the actual
specification, while Part 2 covers compliance testing methods.  Part 1 is
titled "Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images,
Part 1: Requirements and guidelines" and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS
10918-1, ITU-T T.81.  Part 2 is titled "Digital Compression and Coding of
Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 2: Compliance testing" and has document
numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-2, ITU-T T.83.
IJG JPEG 8 introduced an implementation of the JPEG SmartScale extension
which is specified in two documents:  A contributed document at ITU and ISO
with title "ITU-T JPEG-Plus Proposal for Extending ITU-T T.81 for Advanced
Image Coding", April 2006, Geneva, Switzerland.  The latest version of this
document is Revision 3.  And a contributed document ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG1 N
5799 with title "Evolution of JPEG", June/July 2011, Berlin, Germany.
IJG JPEG 9 introduces a reversible color transform for improved lossless
compression which is described in a contributed document ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/
WG1 N 6080 with title "JPEG 9 Lossless Coding", June/July 2012, Paris, France.

The JPEG standard does not specify all details of an interchangeable file
format.  For the omitted details we follow the "JFIF" conventions, version 2.
JFIF version 1 has been adopted as Recommendation ITU-T T.871 (05/2011) :
Information technology - Digital compression and coding of continuous-tone
still images: JPEG File Interchange Format (JFIF).  It is available as a
free download in PDF file format from https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.871.
A PDF file of the older JFIF document is available at
https://www.w3.org/Graphics/JPEG/jfif3.pdf.

The TIFF 6.0 file format specification can be obtained by FTP from
ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/TIFF6.ps.gz.  The JPEG incorporation scheme
found in the TIFF 6.0 spec of 3-June-92 has a number of serious problems.
IJG does not recommend use of the TIFF 6.0 design (TIFF Compression tag 6).
Instead, we recommend the JPEG design proposed by TIFF Technical Note #2
(Compression tag 7).  Copies of this Note can be obtained from
https://www.ijg.org/files/.  It is expected that the next revision
of the TIFF spec will replace the 6.0 JPEG design with the Note's design.
Although IJG's own code does not support TIFF/JPEG, the free libtiff library
uses our library to implement TIFF/JPEG per the Note.

FILE FORMAT WARS
================

The ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG1 standards committee (previously known as JPEG,
together with ITU-T SG16) currently promotes different formats containing
the name "JPEG" which is misleading because these formats are incompatible
with original DCT-based JPEG and are based on faulty technologies.
IJG therefore does not and will not support such momentary mistakes
(see REFERENCES).
There exist also distributions under the name "OpenJPEG" promoting such
kind of formats which is misleading because they don't support original
JPEG images.
We have no sympathy for the promotion of inferior formats.  Indeed, one of
the original reasons for developing this free software was to help force
convergence on common, interoperable format standards for JPEG files.
Don't use an incompatible file format!
(In any case, our decoder will remain capable of reading existing JPEG
image files indefinitely.)

The ISO committee pretends to be "responsible for the popular JPEG" in their
public reports which is not true because they don't respond to actual
requirements for the maintenance of the original JPEG specification.
Furthermore, the ISO committee pretends to "ensure interoperability" with
their standards which is not true because their "standards" support only
application-specific and proprietary use cases and contain mathematically
incorrect code.

There are currently different distributions in circulation containing the
name "libjpeg" which is misleading because they don't have the features and
are incompatible with formats supported by actual IJG libjpeg distributions.
One of those fakes is released by members of the ISO committee and just uses
the name of libjpeg for misdirection of people, similar to the abuse of the
name JPEG as described above, while having nothing in common with actual IJG
libjpeg distributions and containing mathematically incorrect code.
The other one claims to be a "derivative" or "fork" of the original libjpeg,
but violates the license conditions as described under LEGAL ISSUES above
and violates basic C programming properties.
We have no sympathy for the release of misleading, incorrect and illegal
distributions derived from obsolete code bases.
Don't use an obsolete code base!

According to the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) law, IJG has the lawful and
legal right to foreclose on certain standardization bodies and other
institutions or corporations that knowingly perform substantial and
systematic deceptive acts and practices, fraud, theft, and damaging of the
value of the people of this planet without their knowing, willing and
intentional consent.
The titles, ownership, and rights of these institutions and all their assets
are now duly secured and held in trust for the free people of this planet.
People of the planet, on every country, may have a financial interest in
the assets of these former principals, agents, and beneficiaries of the
foreclosed institutions and corporations.
IJG asserts what is: that each man, woman, and child has unalienable value
and rights granted and deposited in them by the Creator and not any one of
the people is subordinate to any artificial principality, corporate fiction
or the special interest of another without their appropriate knowing,
willing and intentional consent made by contract or accommodation agreement.
IJG expresses that which already was.
The people have already determined and demanded that public administration
entities, national governments, and their supporting judicial systems must
be fully transparent, accountable, and liable.
IJG has secured the value for all concerned free people of the planet.

A partial list of foreclosed institutions and corporations ("Hall of Shame")
is currently prepared and will be published later.

libpng/README

README for libpng version 1.6.39
================================

See the note about version numbers near the top of png.h.
See INSTALL for instructions on how to install libpng.

Libpng comes in several distribution formats.  Get libpng-*.tar.gz or
libpng-*.tar.xz if you want UNIX-style line endings in the text files,
or lpng*.7z or lpng*.zip if you want DOS-style line endings.

Version 0.89 was the first official release of libpng.  Don't let the
fact that it's the first release fool you.  The libpng library has been
in extensive use and testing since mid-1995.  By late 1997 it had
finally gotten to the stage where there hadn't been significant
changes to the API in some time, and people have a bad feeling about
libraries with versions < 1.0.  Version 1.0.0 was released in
March 1998.

****
Note that some of the changes to the png_info structure render this
version of the library binary incompatible with libpng-0.89 or
earlier versions if you are using a shared library.  The type of the
"filler" parameter for png_set_filler() has changed from png_byte to
png_uint_32, which will affect shared-library applications that use
this function.

To avoid problems with changes to the internals of the png info_struct,
new APIs have been made available in 0.95 to avoid direct application
access to info_ptr.  These functions are the png_set_<chunk> and
png_get_<chunk> functions.  These functions should be used when
accessing/storing the info_struct data, rather than manipulating it
directly, to avoid such problems in the future.

It is important to note that the APIs did not make current programs
that access the info struct directly incompatible with the new
library, through libpng-1.2.x.  In libpng-1.4.x, which was meant to
be a transitional release, members of the png_struct and the
info_struct can still be accessed, but the compiler will issue a
warning about deprecated usage.  Since libpng-1.5.0, direct access
to these structs is not allowed, and the definitions of the structs
reside in private pngstruct.h and pnginfo.h header files that are not
accessible to applications.  It is strongly suggested that new
programs use the new APIs (as shown in example.c and pngtest.c), and
older programs be converted to the new format, to facilitate upgrades
in the future.
****

Additions since 0.90 include the ability to compile libpng as a
Windows DLL, and new APIs for accessing data in the info struct.
Experimental functions include the ability to set weighting and cost
factors for row filter selection, direct reads of integers from buffers
on big-endian processors that support misaligned data access, faster
methods of doing alpha composition, and more accurate 16->8 bit color
conversion.

The additions since 0.89 include the ability to read from a PNG stream
which has had some (or all) of the signature bytes read by the calling
application.  This also allows the reading of embedded PNG streams that
do not have the PNG file signature.  As well, it is now possible to set
the library action on the detection of chunk CRC errors.  It is possible
to set different actions based on whether the CRC error occurred in a
critical or an ancillary chunk.

For a detailed description on using libpng, read libpng-manual.txt.
For examples of libpng in a program, see example.c and pngtest.c.  For
usage information and restrictions (what little they are) on libpng,
see png.h.  For a description on using zlib (the compression library
used by libpng) and zlib's restrictions, see zlib.h

I have included a general makefile, as well as several machine and
compiler specific ones, but you may have to modify one for your own
needs.

You should use zlib 1.0.4 or later to run this, but it MAY work with
versions as old as zlib 0.95.  Even so, there are bugs in older zlib
versions which can cause the output of invalid compression streams for
some images.

You should also note that zlib is a compression library that is useful
for more things than just PNG files.  You can use zlib as a drop-in
replacement for fread() and fwrite(), if you are so inclined.

zlib should be available at the same place that libpng is, or at
https://zlib.net.

You may also want a copy of the PNG specification.  It is available
as an RFC, a W3C Recommendation, and an ISO/IEC Standard.  You can find
these at http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/pngdocs.html .

This code is currently being archived at libpng.sourceforge.io in the
[DOWNLOAD] area, and at http://libpng.download/src .

This release, based in a large way on Glenn's, Guy's and Andreas'
earlier work, was created and will be supported by myself and the PNG
development group.

libpng/contrib/README.txt


This "contrib" directory contains contributions which are not necessarily under
the libpng license, although all are open source.  They are not part of
libpng proper and are not used for building the library, although some are used
for testing the library via "make check".

libpng/contrib/arm-neon/README

OPERATING SYSTEM SPECIFIC ARM NEON DETECTION
--------------------------------------------

Detection of the ability to execute ARM NEON on an ARM processor requires
operating system support.  (The information is not available in user mode.)

HOW TO USE THIS
---------------

This directory contains C code fragments that can be included in arm/arm_init.c
by setting the macro PNG_ARM_NEON_FILE to the file name in "" or <> at build
time.  This setting is not recorded in pnglibconf.h and can be changed simply by
rebuilding arm/arm_init.o with the required macro definition.

For any of this code to be used the ARM NEON code must be enabled and run time
checks must be supported.  I.e.:

#if PNG_ARM_NEON_OPT > 0
#ifdef PNG_ARM_NEON_CHECK_SUPPORTED

This is done in a 'configure' build by passing configure the argument:

   --enable-arm-neon=check

Apart from the basic Linux implementation in contrib/arm-neon/linux.c this code
is unsupported.  That means that it is not even compiled on a regular basis and
may be broken in any given minor release.

FILE FORMAT
-----------

Each file documents its testing status as of the last time it was tested (which
may have been a long time ago):

STATUS: one of:
   SUPPORTED: This indicates that the file is included in the regularly
         performed test builds and bugs are fixed when discovered.
   COMPILED: This indicates that the code did compile at least once.  See the
         more detailed description for the extent to which the result was
         successful.
   TESTED: This means the code was fully compiled into the libpng test programs
         and these were run at least once.

BUG REPORTS: an email address to which to send reports of problems

The file is a fragment of C code. It should not define any 'extern' symbols;
everything should be static.  It must define the function:

static int png_have_neon(png_structp png_ptr);

That function must return 1 if ARM NEON instructions are supported, 0 if not.
It must not execute png_error unless it detects a bug.  A png_error will prevent
the reading of the PNG and in the future, writing too.

BUG REPORTS
-----------

If you mail a bug report for any file that is not SUPPORTED there may only be
limited response.  Consider fixing it and sending a patch to fix the problem -
this is more likely to result in action.

CONTRIBUTIONS
-------------

You may send contributions of new implementations to
png-mng-implement@sourceforge.net.  Please write code in strict C90 C where
possible.  Obviously OS dependencies are to be expected.  If you submit code you
must have the authors permission and it must have a license that is acceptable
to the current maintainer; in particular that license must permit modification
and redistribution.

Please try to make the contribution a single file and give the file a clear and
unambiguous name that identifies the target OS.  If multiple files really are
required put them all in a sub-directory.

You must also be prepared to handle bug reports from users of the code, either
by joining the png-mng-implement mailing list or by providing an email for the
"BUG REPORTS" entry or both.  Please make sure that the header of the file
contains the STATUS and BUG REPORTS fields as above.

Please list the OS requirements as precisely as possible.  Ideally you should
also list the environment in which the code has been tested and certainly list
any environments where you suspect it might not work.


## Files:
libpng/contrib/conftest/README

This directory contains test configuration files, currently always '.dfa' files
intended to be used in the build by setting the make macro DFA_XTRA to the name
of the file.

These files are used in release validation of the 'configure' builds of libpng
by building 'make check', or 'make all-am' for cross-builds, with each .dfa
file.

The files in this directory may change between minor releases, however
contributions describing specific builds of libpng are welcomed.  There is no
guarantee that libpng will continue to build with such configurations; support
for given configurations can be, and has been, dropped between successive minor
releases.  However if a .dfa file describing a configuration is not in this
directory it is very unlikely that it will be tested before a minor release!

You can use these .dfa files as the basis of new configurations.  Files in this
directory should not have any use restrictions or restrictive licenses.

This directory is not included in the .zip and .7z distributions, which do
not contain 'configure' scripts.

DOCUMENTATION
=============

Examples:
   ${srcdir}/pngusr.dfa
   ${srcdir}/contrib/pngminim/*/pngusr.dfa

Documentation of the options:
   ${srcdir}/scripts/pnglibconf.dfa

Documentation of the file format:
   ${srcdir}/scripts/options.awk

FILE NAMING
===========

File names in this directory may NOT contain any of the five characters:

   - , + * ?

Neither may they contain any space character.

While other characters may be used it is strongly suggested that file names be
limited to lower case Latiin alphabetic characters (a-z), digits (0-9) and, if
necessary the underscore (_) character.  File names should be about 8 characters
long (excluding the .dfa extension).  Submitted .dfa files should have names
between 7 and 16 characters long, shorter names (6 characters or less) are
reserved for standard tests.


## Files:
libpng/contrib/examples/README.txt


This directory (contrib/examples) contains examples of libpng usage.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

                      PNG: The Definitive Guide
                     ===========================

                             Source Code

Chapters 13, 14 and 15 of "PNG: The Definitive Guide" discuss three free,
cross-platform demo programs that show how to use the libpng reference
library:  rpng, rpng2 and wpng.  rpng and rpng2 are viewers; the first is
a very simple example that that shows how a standard file-viewer might use
libpng, while the second is designed to process streaming data and shows
how a web browser might be written.  wpng is a simple command-line program
that reads binary PGM and PPM files (the ``raw'' grayscale and RGB subsets
of PBMPLUS/NetPBM) and converts them to PNG.

The source code for all three demo programs currently compiles under
Unix, OpenVMS, and 32-bit Windows.  (Special thanks to Martin Zinser,
zinser at decus.de, for making the necessary changes for OpenVMS and for
providing an appropriate build script.)  Build instructions can be found
below.

Note that, although the programs are designed to be functional, their
primary purpose is to illustrate how to use libpng to add PNG support to
other programs.  As such, their user interfaces are crude and definitely
are not intended for everyday use.

mation and links to the latest version of the source code, and Chapters
13-15 of the book for detailed discussion of the three programs.

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

 - Prerequisites (in order of compilation):

      - zlib            https://zlib.net/
      - libpng          http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html
      - pngbook         http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/book/sources.html

     The pngbook demo programs are explicitly designed to demonstrate proper
     coding techniques for using the libpng reference library.  As a result,
     you need to download and build both zlib (on which libpng depends) and
     libpng.  A common build setup is to place the zlib, libpng and pngbook
     subdirectory trees ("folders") in the same parent directory.  Then the
     libpng build can refer to files in ../zlib (or ..\zlib or [-.zlib]),
     and similarly for the pngbook build.

     Note that all three packages are designed to be built from a command
     line by default; those who wish to use a graphical or other integrated
     development environments are on their own.


 - Unix:

     Unpack the latest pngbook sources (which should correspond to this
     README file) into a directory and change into that directory.

     Copy Makefile.unx to Makefile and edit the PNG* and Z* variables
     appropriately (possibly also the X* variables if necessary).

     make

     There is no "install" target, so copy the three executables somewhere
     in your path or run them from the current directory.  All three will
     print a basic usage screen when run without any command-line arguments;
     see the book for more details.


 - Windows:

     Unpack the latest pngbook sources (which should correspond to this
     README file) into a folder, open a "DOS shell" or "command prompt"
     or equivalent command-line window, and cd into the folder where you
     unpacked the source code.

     For MSVC, set up the necessary environment variables by invoking

        %devstudio%\vc\bin\vcvars32.bat

     where where %devstudio% is the installation directory for MSVC /
     DevStudio.  If you get "environment out of space" errors under 95/98,
     create a desktop shortcut with "c:\windows\command.com /e:4096" as
     the program command line and set the working directory to the pngbook
     directory.  Then double-click to open the new DOS-prompt window with
     a bigger environment and retry the commands above.

     Copy Makefile.w32 to Makefile and edit the PNGPATH and ZPATH variables
     appropriately (possibly also the "INC" and "LIB" variables if needed).
     Note that the names of the dynamic and static libpng and zlib libraries
     used in the makefile may change in later releases of the libraries.
     Also note that, as of libpng version 1.0.5, MSVC DLL builds do not work.
     This makefile therefore builds statically linked executables, but if
     the DLL problems ever get fixed, uncommenting the appropriate PNGLIB
     and ZLIB lines will build dynamically linked executables instead.

     Do the build by typing

        nmake

     The result should be three executables:  rpng-win.exe, rpng2-win.exe,
     and wpng.exe.  Copy them somewhere in your PATH or run them from the
     current folder.  Like the Unix versions, the two windowed programs
     (rpng and rpng2) now display a usage screen in a console window when
     invoked without command-line arguments; this is new behavior as of
     the June 2001 release.  Note that the programs use the Unix-style "-"
     character to specify options, instead of the more common DOS/Windows
     "/" character.  (For example:  "rpng2-win -bgpat 4 foo.png", not
     "rpng2-win /bgpat 4 foo.png")


 - OpenVMS:

     Unpack the pngbook sources into a subdirectory and change into that
     subdirectory.

     Edit makevms.com appropriately, specifically the zpath and pngpath
     variables.

     @makevms

     To run the programs, they probably first need to be set up as "foreign
     symbols," with "disk" and "dir" set appropriately:

     $ rpng  == "$disk:[dir]rpng-x.exe"
     $ rpng2 == "$disk:[dir]rpng2-x.exe"
     $ wpng  == "$disk:[dir]wpng.exe"

     All three will print a basic usage screen when run without any command-
     line arguments; see the book for more details.  Note that the options
     style is Unix-like, i.e., preceded by "-" rather than "/".


RUNNING THE PROGRAMS:  (VERY) BRIEF INTRO

     rpng is a simple PNG viewer that can display transparent PNGs with a
     specified background color; for example,

        rpng -bgcolor \#ff0000 toucan.png

     would display the image with a red background.  rpng2 is a progressive
     viewer that simulates a web browser in some respects; it can display
     images against either a background color or a dynamically generated
     background image.  For example:

        rpng2 -bgpat 16 toucan.png

     wpng is a purely command-line image converter from binary PBMPLUS/NetPBM
     format (.pgm or .ppm) to PNG; for example,

        wpng -time < toucan-notrans.ppm > toucan-notrans.png

     would convert the specified PPM file (using redirection) to PNG, auto-
     matically setting the PNG modification-time chunk.

     All options can be abbreviated to the shortest unique value; for example,
     "-bgc" for -bgcolor (versus "-bgp" for -bgpat), or "-g" for -gamma.

libpng/contrib/mips-msa/README

OPERATING SYSTEM SPECIFIC MIPS MSA DETECTION
--------------------------------------------

Detection of the ability to execute MIPS MSA on an MIPS processor requires
operating system support.  (The information is not available in user mode.)

HOW TO USE THIS
---------------

This directory contains C code fragments that can be included in mips/mips_init.c
by setting the macro PNG_MIPS_MSA_FILE to the file name in "" or <> at build
time.  This setting is not recorded in pnglibconf.h and can be changed simply by
rebuilding mips/msa_init.o with the required macro definition.

For any of this code to be used the MIPS MSA code must be enabled and run time
checks must be supported.  I.e.:

#if PNG_MIPS_MSA_OPT > 0
#ifdef PNG_MIPS_MSA_CHECK_SUPPORTED

This is done in a 'configure' build by passing configure the argument:

   --enable-mips-msa=check

Apart from the basic Linux implementation in contrib/mips-msa/linux.c this code
is unsupported.  That means that it is not even compiled on a regular basis and
may be broken in any given minor release.

FILE FORMAT
-----------

Each file documents its testing status as of the last time it was tested (which
may have been a long time ago):

STATUS: one of:
   SUPPORTED: This indicates that the file is included in the regularly
         performed test builds and bugs are fixed when discovered.
   COMPILED: This indicates that the code did compile at least once.  See the
         more detailed description for the extent to which the result was
         successful.
   TESTED: This means the code was fully compiled into the libpng test programs
         and these were run at least once.

BUG REPORTS: an email address to which to send reports of problems

The file is a fragment of C code. It should not define any 'extern' symbols;
everything should be static.  It must define the function:

static int png_have_msa(png_structp png_ptr);

That function must return 1 if MIPS MSA instructions are supported, 0 if not.
It must not execute png_error unless it detects a bug.  A png_error will prevent
the reading of the PNG and in the future, writing too.

BUG REPORTS
-----------

If you mail a bug report for any file that is not SUPPORTED there may only be
limited response.  Consider fixing it and sending a patch to fix the problem -
this is more likely to result in action.

CONTRIBUTIONS
-------------

You may send contributions of new implementations to
png-mng-implement@sourceforge.net.  Please write code in strict C90 C where
possible.  Obviously OS dependencies are to be expected.  If you submit code you
must have the authors permission and it must have a license that is acceptable
to the current maintainer; in particular that license must permit modification
and redistribution.

Please try to make the contribution a single file and give the file a clear and
unambiguous name that identifies the target OS.  If multiple files really are
required put them all in a sub-directory.

You must also be prepared to handle bug reports from users of the code, either
by joining the png-mng-implement mailing list or by providing an email for the
"BUG REPORTS" entry or both.  Please make sure that the header of the file
contains the STATUS and BUG REPORTS fields as above.

Please list the OS requirements as precisely as possible.  Ideally you should
also list the environment in which the code has been tested and certainly list
any environments where you suspect it might not work.

libpng/contrib/pngminus/README.txt

PngMinus
--------
(copyright Willem van Schaik, 1999-2019)



Some history
------------
Soon after the creation of PNG in 1995, the need was felt for a set of
pnmtopng / pngtopnm utilities. Independently Alexander Lehmann and I
(Willem van Schaik) started such a project. Luckily we discovered this
and merged the two, which later became part of NetPBM, available from
SourceForge.

These two utilities have many, many options and make use of most of the
features of PNG, like gamma, alpha, sbit, text-chunks, etc. This makes
the utilities quite complex and by now not anymore very maintainable.
When we wrote these programs, libpng was still in an early stage.
Therefore, lots of the functionality that we put in our software can now
be done using transform-functions in libpng.

Finally, to compile these programs, you need to have installed and
compiled three libraries: libpng, zlib and netpbm. Especially the latter
makes the whole setup a bit bulky. But that's unavoidable given the many
features of pnmtopng.


What now (1999)
---------------
At this moment libpng is in a very stable state and can do much of the
work done in pnmtopng. Also, pnmtopng needs to be upgraded to the new
interface of libpng. Hence, it is time for a rewrite from the ground up
of pnmtopng and pngtopnm. This will happen in the near future (stay
tuned). The new package will get a different name to distinguish it from
the old one: PngPlus.

To experiment a bit with the new interface of libpng, I started off with
a small prototype that contains only the basic functionality. It doesn't
have any of the options to read or write special chunks and it will do
no gamma correction. But this makes it also a simple program that is
quite easy to understand and can serve well as a template for other
software developments. By now there are of course a couple of programs,
like Greg Roelofs' rpng/wpng, that can be used just as good.


Can and can not
---------------
As this is the small brother of the future PngPlus, I called this fellow
PngMinus. Because I started this development in good-old Turbo-C, I
avoided the use the netpbm library, which requires DOS extenders. Again,
another reason to call it PngMinus (minus netpbm :-). So, part of the
program are some elementary routines to read / write pgm- and ppm-files.
It does not handle B&W pbm-files, but instead you could do pgm with bit-
depth 1.

The downside of this approach is that you can not use them on images
that require blocks of memory bigger than 64k (the DOS version). For
larger images you will get an out-of-memory error.

As said before, PngMinus doesn't correct for gamma. When reading
png-files you can do this just as well by piping the output of png2pnm
to pnmgamma, one of the standard PbmPlus tools. This same scenario will
most probably also be followed in the full-blown future PngPlus, with
the addition of course of the possibility to create gamma-chunks when
writing png-files.

On the other hand it supports alpha-channels. When reading a png-image
you can write the alpha-channel into a pgm-file. And when creating an
RGB+A png-image, you just combine a ppm-file with a corresponding
pgm-file containing the alpha-channel. When reading, transparency chunks
are converted into an alpha-channel and from there on treated the same
way.

Finally you can opt for writing ascii or binary pgm- and ppm-files. When
the bit-depth is 16, the format will always be ascii.


Using it
--------
To distinguish them from pnmtopng and PngPlus, the utilities are named
png2pnm and pnm2png (2 instead of to). The input- and output-files can
be given as parameters or through redirection. Therefore the programs
can be part of a pipe.

To list the options type "png2pnm -h" or "pnm2png -h".


Just like Scandinavian furniture
--------------------------------
You have to put it together yourself. I developed the software on MS-DOS
with Turbo-C 3.0 and RedHat Linux 4.2 with gcc. In both cases I used
libpng-1.0.4 and zlib-1.1.3. By now (2019) it is twenty years later and
more current versions are OK.

The makefile assumes that the libpng libraries can be found in ../.. and
libz in ../../../zlib. But you can change this to for example ../libpng
and ../zlib. The makefile creates two versions of each program, one with
static library support and the other using shared libraries.

If you create a ../pngsuite directory and then store the basn####.png
files from PngSuite (http://www.schaik.com/pngsuite/) in there, you can
test the proper functioning of PngMinus by running pngminus.sh.


Warranty
-------
Please, remember that this was just a small experiment to learn a few
things. It will have many unforeseen features <vbg> ... who said bugs? Use
it when you are in need for something simple or when you want a starting
point for developing your own stuff.

OPERATING SYSTEM SPECIFIC POWERPC DETECTION
--------------------------------------------

Detection of the ability to execute POWERPC on processor requires
operating system support.  (The information is not available in user mode.)

Currently only this feature is supported only for linux platform.

HOW TO USE THIS
---------------

This directory contains C code fragments that can be included in powerpc/powerpc_init.c
by setting the macro PNG_POWERPC_VSX_FILE to the file name in "" or <> at build
time.  This setting is not recorded in pnglibconf.h and can be changed simply by
rebuilding arm/arm_init.o with the required macro definition.

For any of this code to be used the POWERPC code must be enabled and run time
checks must be supported.  I.e.:

#if PNG_POWERPC_VSX_OPT > 0
#ifdef PNG_POWERPC_VSX_CHECK_SUPPORTED

This is done in a 'configure' build by passing configure the argument:

   --enable-powerpc-vsx=check

FILE FORMAT
-----------

Each file documents its testing status as of the last time it was tested (which
may have been a long time ago):

STATUS: one of:
   SUPPORTED: This indicates that the file is included in the regularly
         performed test builds and bugs are fixed when discovered.
   COMPILED: This indicates that the code did compile at least once.  See the
         more detailed description for the extent to which the result was
         successful.
   TESTED: This means the code was fully compiled into the libpng test programs
         and these were run at least once.

BUG REPORTS: an email address to which to send reports of problems

The file is a fragment of C code. It should not define any 'extern' symbols;
everything should be static.  It must define the function:

static int png_have_vsx(png_structp png_ptr);

That function must return 1 if POWERPC_VSX instructions are supported, 0 if not.
It must not execute png_error unless it detects a bug.  A png_error will prevent
the reading of the PNG and in the future, writing too.

BUG REPORTS
-----------

If you mail a bug report for any file that is not SUPPORTED there may only be
limited response.  Consider fixing it and sending a patch to fix the problem -
this is more likely to result in action.

CONTRIBUTIONS
-------------

You may send contributions of new implementations to
png-mng-implement@sourceforge.net.  Please write code in strict C90 C where
possible.  Obviously OS dependencies are to be expected.  If you submit code you
must have the authors permission and it must have a license that is acceptable

"BUG REPORTS" entry or both.  Please make sure that the header of the file
contains the STATUS and BUG REPORTS fields as above.

Please list the OS requirements as precisely as possible.  Ideally you should
also list the environment in which the code has been tested and certainly list
any environments where you suspect it might not work.

Instructions for building libpng using Microsoft Visual Studio
==============================================================

Copyright (c) 2018,2022 Cosmin Truta
Copyright (c) 2010,2013,2015 Glenn Randers-Pehrson

This code is released under the libpng license.
For conditions of distribution and use, see the disclaimer and license
in png.h

This directory contains a solution for building libpng under Microsoft
Visual Studio 2019.  It may also work under earlier or later versions
of Visual Studio.  You should be familiar with Visual Studio before
using this solution.

Initial preparations
--------------------
You must enter some information in zlib.props before attempting to
build with this 'solution'.  Please read and edit zlib.props first.
You will probably not be familiar with the contents of zlib.props -
do not worry, it is mostly harmless.

This is all you need to do to build the 'release' and 'release library'
configurations.

Debugging
---------
The release configurations default to /Ox optimization.  Full debugging
information is produced (in the .pdb), but if you encounter a problem
the optimization may make it difficult to debug.  Simply rebuild with a
lower optimization level (e.g. /Od.)

Linking your application
------------------------
Normally you should link against the 'release' configuration.  This
builds a DLL for libpng with the default runtime options used by Visual
Studio.  In particular the runtime library is the "MultiThreaded DLL"
version.  If you use Visual Studio defaults to build your application,
you should have no problems.

If you don't use the Visual Studio defaults your application must still
be built with the default runtime option (/MD).  If, for some reason,
it is not then your application will crash inside libpng16.dll as soon
as libpng tries to read from a file handle you pass in.

If you do not want to use the DLL, and prefer static linking instead,
you may choose the 'release library' configuration.  This is built with
a non-standard runtime library - the "MultiThreaded" version.  When you
build your application, it must be compiled with this option (/MT),
otherwise it will not build (if you are lucky) or it will crash (if you
are not.) See the WARNING file that is distributed with this README.

Stop reading here
-----------------
You have enough information to build a working application.

Debug versions have limited support
-----------------------------------
This solution includes limited support for debug versions of libpng.
You do not need these unless your own solution itself uses debug builds
(it is far more effective to debug on the release builds, there is no
point building a special debug build unless you have heap corruption
problems that you can't track down.)

The debug build of libpng is minimally supported.  Support for debug
builds of zlib is also minimal.  Please keep this in mind, if you want
to use it.

WARNING
-------
Libpng 1.6.x does not use the default run-time library when building
static library builds of libpng; instead of the shared DLL runtime, it
uses a static runtime.  If you need to change this, make sure to change
the setting on all the relevant projects:

    libpng
    zlib
    all the test programs

The runtime library settings for each build are as follows:

               Release        Debug
    DLL         /MD            /MDd
    Library     /MT            /MTd

Also, be sure to build libpng, zlib, and your project, all for the same
platform (e.g., 32-bit or 64-bit).

# OPENJPEG Library and Applications

## What is OpenJPEG ? 

OpenJPEG is an open-source JPEG 2000 codec written in C language. It has been developed in order to promote the use of [JPEG 2000](http://www.jpeg.org/jpeg2000), a still-image compression standard from the Joint Photographic Experts Group ([JPEG](http://www.jpeg.org)).  Since April 2015, it is officially recognized by ISO/IEC and ITU-T as a [JPEG 2000 Reference Software](http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.804-201504-I!Amd2).

## Who can use the code ?
[![badge-license]][link-license]

Anyone. As the OpenJPEG code is released under the [BSD 2-clause "Simplified" License][link-license], anyone can use or modify the code, even for commercial applications. The only restriction is to retain the copyright in the sources or in the binaries documentation. Of course, if you modified the code in a way that might be of interest for other users, you are encouraged to share it (through a [github pull request](https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg/pulls) or by filling an [issue](https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg/issues)) but this is not a requirement.

## How to install and use OpenJPEG ?
API Documentation needs a major refactoring. Meanwhile, you can check [installation](https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg/wiki/Installation) instructions and [codec documentation](https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg/wiki/DocJ2KCodec).
    
## Current Status

[![badge-msvc-build]][link-msvc-build] 

[![badge-coverity]][link-coverity]

## Who are the developers ?

The library is developed and maintained by the Image and Signal Processing Group ([ISPGroup](http://sites.uclouvain.be/ispgroup/)), in the Université catholique de Louvain ([UCL](http://www.uclouvain.be/en-index.html), with the support of the [CNES](https://cnes.fr/), the [CS](http://www.c-s.fr/) company and the [intoPIX](http://www.intopix.com) company. The JPWL module has been developed by the Digital Signal Processing Lab ([DSPLab](http://dsplab.diei.unipg.it/)) of the University of Perugia, Italy ([UNIPG](http://www.unipg.it/)).

## API/ABI

An API/ABI timeline is automatically updated [here][link-api-timeline].

OpenJPEG strives to provide a stable API/ABI for your applications. As such it
only exposes a limited subset of its functions.  It uses a mechanism of
exporting/hiding functions. If you are unsure which functions you can use in
your applications, you should compile OpenJPEG using something similar to gcc:
`-fvisibility=hidden` compilation flag.
See also: http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility

On windows, MSVC directly supports export/hiding function and as such the only
API available is the one supported by OpenJPEG.

## About

This package contains an **OCR engine** - `libtesseract` and a **command line program** - `tesseract`.

Tesseract 4 adds a new neural net (LSTM) based [OCR engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) which is focused on line recognition, but also still supports the legacy Tesseract OCR engine of Tesseract 3 which works by recognizing character patterns. Compatibility with Tesseract 3 is enabled by using the Legacy OCR Engine mode (--oem 0).
It also needs [traineddata](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Data-Files.html) files which support the legacy engine, for example those from the [tessdata](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata) repository.

Stefan Weil is the current lead developer. Ray Smith was the lead developer until 2018. The maintainer is Zdenko Podobny. For a list of contributors see [AUTHORS](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/main/AUTHORS)
and GitHub's log of [contributors](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/graphs/contributors).

Tesseract has **unicode (UTF-8) support**, and can **recognize [more than 100 languages](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Data-Files-in-different-versions.html)** "out of the box".

Tesseract supports **[various image formats](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/InputFormats)** including PNG, JPEG and TIFF.

Tesseract supports **various output formats**: plain text, hOCR (HTML), PDF, invisible-text-only PDF, TSV and ALTO.

You should note that in many cases, in order to get better OCR results, you'll need to **[improve the quality](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/ImproveQuality.html) of the image** you are giving Tesseract.

This project **does not include a GUI application**. If you need one, please see the [3rdParty](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/User-Projects-%E2%80%93-3rdParty.html) documentation.

Tesseract **can be trained to recognize other languages**.
See [Tesseract Training](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Training-Tesseract.html) for more information.

## Brief history

Tesseract was originally developed at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories Bristol UK and at Hewlett-Packard Co, Greeley Colorado USA between 1985 and 1994, with some more changes made in 1996 to port to Windows, and some C++izing in 1998. In 2005 Tesseract was open sourced by HP. From 2006 until November 2018 it was developed by Google.

Major version 5 is the current stable version and started with release
[5.0.0](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/releases/tag/5.0.0) on November 30, 2021. Newer minor versions and bugfix versions are available from
[GitHub](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/releases/).

Latest source code is available from [main branch on GitHub](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/tree/main).
Open issues can be found in [issue tracker](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues),
and [planning documentation](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Planning.html).

See **[Release Notes](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/ReleaseNotes.html)**
and **[Change Log](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/main/ChangeLog)** for more details of the releases.

## Installing Tesseract

You can either [Install Tesseract via pre-built binary package](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html)
or [build it from source](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Compiling.html).

A C++ compiler with good C++17 support is required for building Tesseract from source.

## Running Tesseract

Basic **[command line usage](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Command-Line-Usage.html)**:

    tesseract imagename outputbase [-l lang] [--oem ocrenginemode] [--psm pagesegmode] [configfiles...]

For more information about the various command line options use `tesseract --help` or `man tesseract`.

Examples can be found in the [documentation](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Command-Line-Usage.html#simplest-invocation-to-ocr-an-image).

## For developers

Developers can use `libtesseract` [C](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/main/include/tesseract/capi.h) or
[C++](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/main/include/tesseract/baseapi.h) API to build their own application. If you need bindings to `libtesseract` for other programming languages, please see the
[wrapper](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/AddOns.html#tesseract-wrappers) section in the AddOns documentation.

Documentation of Tesseract generated from source code by doxygen can be found on [tesseract-ocr.github.io](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/).

This is a windows application for creating ICC profiles.  It has multiple uses 
described below.

The Device N profiles controls can be used to accurately define
color for PDF and PS DeviceN color spaces.  To use this tool, you will need 
to have CIELAB measurements of M^N equally spaced in device values from min 
to max inkoverprinted spot colors (or spot and process colors).  See the example 
folder for sample input when we have N=2 colors with M=6 samples.  You will also 
need a file that has the  names of the colorants as they are used for the 
DeviceN color space in the document.  The order of the names must be related to 
the rate of change of the CIELAB data in the hypercube of measurements.  The 
first name relates to the device value that changes more slowly in the CIELAB 
data, while the last name relates to the device value that changes more rapidly 
in the CIELAB data.  To include the DeviceN ICC profiles in ghostscript when 
processing a PDF or PS file that includes those spaces, use 
-sDeviceNProfile="5channel.icc; 6channel.icc; duotone.icc". 

The Thresholding Profiles controls allow one to generate ICC profiles that will 
threshold  the output value for the device gray profile.  The threshold range is 
based upon L*.  Values with an L* above the threshold value will map to white 
those below will map to black.

Default Profile Generation is used to create ICC profiles that can emulate the 
old PS color mapping routines.  The mapping to CMYK requires the specification
of a particular undercolor and black generation mappings (UCR/BG).  The data is 
specified by the user in a table of tab delimited values.  The range of values
is 0 to 255 and example sets of data are given in the files ucr_bg_no_k.txt and
ucr_bg_max_k.  The CMYK ICC profiles generated from these data are given in
no_k.icc and max_k.icc.  The max_k.icc profile may be useful in generating black
only text output from neutral source data. This is achieved using ghostscript with
the option -sTextICCProfile=max_k.icc (where max_k.icc is included in ./iccprofiles
and ghostscript is built with the ROM file system).

Release notes ETS version 150
8 May 2014
Copyright 2000-2014 Artifex Sotware Inc.

This release removed the SSE and VEC code so that we could focus on 
repairing lingering issues with the C code. 

Robin fixed issues in the actual ETS code.  In particular he fixed issues with 
the "white count test" and the FS weights.  We did a fair amount of testing 
with the various parameters. We also added more useful image outputs in the test 
bed allowing the creation of multiple colorants in PSD format including 16bit.
We also moved to a Visual Studio solution for the project.

Release notes ETS version 138
26 Apr 2006
Copyright 2000-2010 Artifex Sotware Inc.
 
This is the latest unified release of Even Tone Screening. The core
ETS algorithm has been highly tuned for modern inkjet printers such as
the latest EPSON seven color devices. In addition, there are alternate
versions of the core screening algorithm written for both Altivec
(G4/PPC 970) and SSE2 (Pentium 4) instruction sets. The quality of the
results with assembly speedup is comparable, but will not be
bit-identical to the C code.


README for Even Better Screening

EBS is the newest refinement of Even Toned Screening. It is based on
the same fundamental algorithms as ETS, and adds several interesting
features.

1. It's possible to screen all planes in tandem, rather than screening
each plane independent. The result is a more even distribution of
inks, and an avoidance of "interference patterns" between similar fine
structure in the planes.

2. The number of levels of output is adjustable at runtime. Most
modern inkjets support multiple drop sizes, and the number of discrete
drop sizes seems to be increasing.

3. Dot aspect ratios of 1:1, 2:1, and 4:1 are directly supported.

4. An option exists to apply Even Toned smoothing to shadow dots as
well as highlight dots. In print modes where individual white dots
in the shadow areas are visible, this avoids wormy patterns. It is
a runtime option because there is a speed penalty. [ Note: this
option not fully supported in the current release ]

5. More parameters are tunable at runtime, including the amplitude of
added random noise, and the scale for the Even Toned output dependent
feedback signal.

Some usage tips:

The default parameters for even_c1_scale, rand_scale, and do_shadows
are all 0, and should give good results. The reasonable range for
rand_scale is about -4 .. 3. Higher values result in more randomness.
The effects should be quite easy to see. even_c1_scale produces a more
subtle effect. Values of -1 or -2 should produce slightly less regular
patterns in highlights. This might be a good idea on printers with
poor accuracy between passes, for example in bidirectional modes.
As mentioned above, set do_shadows to 1 if wormy patterns are visible
in shadows. At high resolutions on most inkjet printers, the dots are
so close together that individual white pixels cannot be seen.

The planes in the call to even_better_line() should be sorted in
darkest-to-lightest order, for example K, C, M, c, m, Y. The
strengths[] parameter should be an array of approximate darkness
values for the inks, for example { 128, 50, 50, 25, 25, 10 }. It
might be worth fiddling with the strength parameters.


Compiling SSE2

To enable SSE2 in evenbetter-rll.c, enable the #define USE_AVEC
conditional compile.

The SSE2 optimized code is in the assembly language file eb_sse2.s.
In addition, I've included two win32-format object files, with and
without the leading underscore. I believe the former is the one to use
for both MS and Watcom compilers.

You can use the NASM tool to reassemble the eb_sse2.s file. Use the
following command line:

nasm eb_sse2.s -f win32

Most compilers will need an additional underscore prefix in front of
the global symbols. There's an _eb_sse2.s file that's the same as
eb_sse2.s except for this change, and it can be assembled using the
same command line as above, just with _eb_sse2.s as the filename.

The included Makefile_sse2 will compile the test_evenbetter executable
on Linux platforms. This utility acts as a pipe and converts pgm to
pgm.


Release notes for 2003-10-21 Altivec-optimized EvenBetter code drop

1. Compiling

To enable Altivec in evenbetter-rll.c, enable the #define USE_AVEC
conditional compile.

The Altivec optimized code is in the C-language file eb_avec.c, using
the Altivec intrinsics. Most up-to-date compilers should have support
for this. With GCC, use the following command line:

gcc -faltivec -O2 -Wall -Wmissing-prototypes   -c -o eb_avec.o eb_avec.c

Note that the -O3 option was tested and did not succeed, at least on
GCC 3.3, build 1435.

On other compilers, it may be necessary to define the HAVE_ALTIVEC_H
preprocessor macro.

The included Makefile_avec will compile the test_evenbetter executable
on OS X platforms. This utility acts as a pipe and converts pgm to
pgm.

2. Code changes

For the most part, this code uses the same API as before. However,
there is one important change: destination buffers _must_ be aligned
to 16-byte boundaries, and should also have an additional 16 bytes of
padding at the end.

I've provided eb_malloc_aligned() and eb_free_aligned() as handy
utility functions for allocating aligned memory blocks. See the
allocation of "obuf" in the sample code (test_evenbetter.c) for an
example.

3. Performance and quality

Barring bugs, quality should be almost identical to the scalar
version.

I did not implement the test for G4 capability, as it's fairly
dependent on platform specifics. Currently, G4 is always assumed,
so the code is likely to crash when run on G3's. To fix this,
edit the line "using_vectors = 1;" so that vectors are only enabled
when the G4/G5 is detected. See:

http://developer.apple.com/hardware/ve/g3_compatibility.html

Performance is most optimal when the number of planes is a multiple of
4. Screening 5 planes will take about the same time as screening 8.


Tone-dependent randomness scaling

As of version 134, ETS can accept lookup tables to control the tone-
dependent randomness scaling. If you do not wish to use this feature,
you must set the new rand_scale_luts field of EvenBetterParams to
NULL.

Otherwise, rand_scale_luts has the same layout as luts - an array of
pointers, one for each plane, to int arrays of size ET_SRC_MAX + 1.
Each value of the array corresponds to one input tone level; in general,
if you change the luts, you'll want to change the rand_scale_luts
accordingly.

The nominal value is 65536, which is a fairly small level of
randomness.  In general, gray values near round rational numbers (1/2,
1/3, etc.) will need higher levels of randomness in order to avoid
repeating patterns. The current default, as computed in
eb_compute_randshift, peaks at 2 << 19 for 1/4 and 1/2, 2 << 18 for
1/3, and 2 << 17 for 1/6 and 1/9.

Note also that even when using the rand_scale_luts, the rand_scale
parameter still has the effect of globally scaling the randomness
value. Each increment by one of rand_scale is equivalent to doubling
the values in the rand_scale luts. simultaneously doubling the
rand_scale_lut values and decreasing rand_scale by 1 has no effect.

To really fine-tune the tone-dependent randomness for a device, we
recommend running grayscale test files with several different
constant values for the luts, then visually choosing the best value
for each grayscale value in the test file. Different devices will be
sensitive to different patterns, depending on the details of the
weaving.

Lastly, keep in mind that the randomness scaling is quantized to
powers of two in the scalar code, but is smoothly variable in the
vector versions.


Notes on per-channel even_c1_scale settings

As of version 135, this code supports per-channel setting of
even_c1_scale, as a way to control artifacts in "dirty highlights".
Recommended values are -2 for full-strength inks for which light
variants exist (magenta, cyan, and black on EPSON 7-color printer),
and 0 for all other inks.


Notes on mseveneighths

The eb_avec vector version contains an experimental workaround for
problems in "dirty highlights". It is disabled by default, but can
easily be enabled by uncommenting these two lines in eb_avec.c:

	//	f_4 = vec_abs(f_3);
	//	f_3 = vec_madd(f_4, mseveneighths, f_3);

The values in mseveneighths in eb_avec.c can also be adjusted -
while the current value is -.875, values of -.90 or -.95 may be
more effective in controlling the dirty highlights problem. However,
values too near -1 seem to create other artifacts.

Pending feedback from users, this experimental feature will either
be removed from all versions, or added to all versions.


Partial version history

Version 138 contains a fix to eb_malloc_aligned for crashes when the
base allocator is aligned to 4-byte but not 8-byte boundaries. Also,
the .obj files for eb_sse2.s are updated, while in some 137 tarballs
they were stale.

Version 137 mostly contains small changes to the vector code to make
it more like the scalar version.

[There was never a consistent 136 release, although some code did go
out with that version number]

Version 135 adds per-channel control of even_c1_scale.

Version 134 has tone-dependent randomness scaling.

Version 133 has some fixes to make the code compile in C++.

Version 132 fixes some improperly merged files in the 131 release.

Version 131 contains a fix for a subtle problem in the noisy highlight
change in 130, as well as more robust support for > 8bpp deep images
on vector platforms.

Version 130 contains a quality improvement in noisy highlight regions.

Version 129 contains performance tuning for the SSE2 implementation.

Version 128 contains a significant speedup in the prep (Altivec only),
specialized to 8-but LUT's with gamma 1.0, 1.8, or 2.0. There is a new
"gamma" parameter to enable it - a value of 0.0 uses the old LUT-based
code.

In addition, make sure the input buffer is allocated with 16-byte
alignment, and is also padded up to a size which is a multiple of 16
bytes.

This version also unifies the SSE2 release. To enable, undefine
USE_AVEC and define USE_SSE2 at the top of evenbetter-rll.c.

toolbin/halftone/gen_ordered/README

Ordered Dither Screen Creation Tool. Copyright 2010-2021 Artifex Software, Inc.

This code is designed to enable the creation of clustered dot threshold arrays
for halftoning, which can provide high lpi without quantization issues.  As
the lpi requirements of a halftone screen increases and begins to approach the
limits of the printer resolution, the size of the clustered dot decreases and
the number of levels that can be represented by the clustered dot decreases. 
To overcome this, the clustered dots are placed in a larger threshold array,
where the threshold values of the individual clustered dots scaled are
dithered to enable the representation of more gray levels within the larger
screen.  The dithering is performed in a manner that is pleasing to the visual
system.

The command line and parameters are as follows:

gen_ordered [-a target_angle] -d [dot_shape] -f [ps | ppm | raw | raw16 | tos]
    [-l target_lpi] [-q target_quantization_levels] [-r resolution]
    [-s size_of_supercell] 

where:

target_angle: The desired screen angle in degrees. [default 0 degrees]

dot_shape: The index number of the dot shape, CIRCLE, REDBOOK_CIRCLE, INVERTED,
    RHOMBOID, LINE_X, LINE_Y, DIAMOND1, DIAMOND2 or ROUNDSPOT values from 0 to 8,
    respectively.

target_lpi: The desired resolution of the screen in lines/inch. [default 300dpi]

target_quantization_levels:  indicates the desired number of "gray" levels
    that you wish to achieve with the screen (e.g. 256). [default 256]
    Special note on this option.  To achieve a particular quantization
    level, it is neccessary that the size_of_supercell is sufficiently large.
    Since the default size of size_of_supercell is set to 1, the minimum
    possible size is always used and the target quantization may not be 
    achieved.  A warning is displayed to indicate this condition and a minimum
    size is suggested.

resolution: The resolution of the output device in dots/inch. Horizontal and
    vertical resolution can be different if given as -rHxV where H is the
    horizontal, and V is the vertical resolution.  [default 300dpi]

size_of_supercell: The specified size of the supercell will impact the number
    of achievable levels.  If a small size is specified (example 1) the
    smallest periodic cell will be created, regardless of the setting for
    target_quantization_levels and it is possible that target_quantization_levels
    will not be achieved.  size_of_supercell should be set to something
    reasonably large to achieve a specified target_quantization_levels, for
    example 64.  Work is underway to have this value optimally set based upon
    the desired number of gray levels.

The output format (-f format) [default: tos] can be one of:

Portable Pixmap (ppm): The screen is stored in a .ppm image that is readily
    viewed by most image viewers. A maximum of 256 levels can be written in the
    format.  

PostScript (ps): The output will be a screen that can readily be brought into
    ghostscript.  For example:

    gswin32c -r300 -dDisplayFormat=16#20102 -c \
        "(Screen_20x10.ps) run sethalftone" examples/tiger.eps

    This will be a HalftoneType 3, 8-bit threshold array unless there are more
    than 256 levels. For up to 65,536 levels a HalftoneType 16 Postscript
    threshold array will be output.

Raw (raw): An 8 bit row ordered Width x Height threshold array that is
    periodic vertically and horizontally.  The size of the array is indicated in
    the output file name, for example Screen_Dithered_WxH.raw. A maximum of 256
    levels can be written in this format.  

16-bitRaw (raw16): An 16 bit row ordered Width x Height threshold array that
    is periodic vertically and horizontally.  The size of the array is indicated
    in the output file name, for example Screen_Dithered_WxH.16.raw. A maximum of
    65536 levels can be written in this format.  

Turn-On-Sequence (tos): A format compatible with the 'thresh_remap' program.
    This consists of a line with the Width and Height of the threshold array as
    "# W=%d H=%d\n" followed by (width * height) x, y pairs in the format "%d\t%d
    n". This format can support more than 65,536 levels, and is the default format.

Currently the code is limited in a few features, which will be included in the
near future:

1) The code currently only creates bi-level threshold arrays.  It is planned
   to enable the creation of multi-level threshold arrays.  Due to the manner
   in which the screens are created, this should be a simple task.

2) Often it is desired to incorporate a tone reproduction curve (TRC) into the
   design of a screen.  While not currently supported, the plan is add that
   option into this code. The thresh_remap program can be used to incorporate
   a TRC from the 'tos' format.

3) Typically screens are designed off line and provided as a threshold array
   to most applications.  In postscript, it is possible that screens can be
   specified within the document with specific attributes including line
   frequency and dot shape.  This code needs significant optimization before
   it should be folded into the ghostscript code base for use in this manner.

4) Minimum dot size handling is also a feature to be added.

ZLIB DATA COMPRESSION LIBRARY

zlib 1.2.13 is a general purpose data compression library.  All the code is
thread safe.  The data format used by the zlib library is described by RFCs
(Request for Comments) 1950 to 1952 in the files
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1950 (zlib format), rfc1951 (deflate format) and
rfc1952 (gzip format).

All functions of the compression library are documented in the file zlib.h
(volunteer to write man pages welcome, contact zlib@gzip.org).  A usage example
of the library is given in the file test/example.c which also tests that
the library is working correctly.  Another example is given in the file
test/minigzip.c.  The compression library itself is composed of all source
files in the root directory.

To compile all files and run the test program, follow the instructions given at
the top of Makefile.in.  In short "./configure; make test", and if that goes
well, "make install" should work for most flavors of Unix.  For Windows, use
one of the special makefiles in win32/ or contrib/vstudio/ .  For VMS, use
make_vms.com.

Questions about zlib should be sent to <zlib@gzip.org>, or to Gilles Vollant
<info@winimage.com> for the Windows DLL version.  The zlib home page is
http://zlib.net/ .  Before reporting a problem, please check this site to
verify that you have the latest version of zlib; otherwise get the latest
version and check whether the problem still exists or not.

PLEASE read the zlib FAQ http://zlib.net/zlib_faq.html before asking for help.

Mark Nelson <markn@ieee.org> wrote an article about zlib for the Jan.  1997
issue of Dr.  Dobb's Journal; a copy of the article is available at

Notes for some targets:

- For Windows DLL versions, please see win32/DLL_FAQ.txt

- For 64-bit Irix, deflate.c must be compiled without any optimization. With
  -O, one libpng test fails. The test works in 32 bit mode (with the -n32
  compiler flag). The compiler bug has been reported to SGI.

- zlib doesn't work with gcc 2.6.3 on a DEC 3000/300LX under OSF/1 2.1 it works
  when compiled with cc.

- On Digital Unix 4.0D (formely OSF/1) on AlphaServer, the cc option -std1 is
  necessary to get gzprintf working correctly. This is done by configure.

- zlib doesn't work on HP-UX 9.05 with some versions of /bin/cc. It works with
  other compilers. Use "make test" to check your compiler.

- gzdopen is not supported on RISCOS or BEOS.

- For PalmOs, see http://palmzlib.sourceforge.net/

we recommend the users to update their ZLib unit.


Summary of modifications
========================

- Improved makefile, adapted to zlib version 1.2.1.

- Some field types from TZStreamRec are changed from Integer to
  Longint, for consistency with the zlib.h header, and for 64-bit
  readiness.

- The zlib_version constant is updated.

- The new Z_RLE strategy has its corresponding symbolic constant.

- The allocation and deallocation functions and function types
  (TAlloc, TFree, zlibAllocMem and zlibFreeMem) are now cdecl,
  and _malloc and _free are added as C RTL stubs.  As a result,
  the original C sources of zlib can be compiled out of the box,
  and linked to the ZLib unit.


Suggestions for improvements
============================

Currently, the ZLib unit provides only a limited wrapper around
the zlib library, and much of the original zlib functionality is
missing.  Handling compressed file formats like ZIP/GZIP or PNG
cannot be implemented without having this functionality.
Applications that handle these formats are either using their own,
duplicated code, or not using the ZLib unit at all.

Here are a few suggestions:

- Checksum class wrappers around adler32() and crc32(), similar
  to the Java classes that implement the java.util.zip.Checksum
  interface.

- The ability to read and write raw deflate streams, without the
  zlib stream header and trailer.  Raw deflate streams are used
  in the ZIP file format.

- The ability to read and write gzip streams, used in the GZIP
  file format, and normally produced by the gzip program.

- The ability to select a different compression strategy, useful
  to PNG and MNG image compression, and to multimedia compression
  in general.  Besides the compression level

    TCompressionLevel = (clNone, clFastest, clDefault, clMax);

  which, in fact, could have used the 'z' prefix and avoided
  TColor-like symbols

    TCompressionLevel = (zcNone, zcFastest, zcDefault, zcMax);

  there could be a compression strategy

    TCompressionStrategy = (zsDefault, zsFiltered, zsHuffmanOnly, zsRle);

- ZIP and GZIP stream handling via TStreams.

## Files:
zlib/contrib/dotzlib/readme.txt

This directory contains a .Net wrapper class library for the ZLib1.dll

The wrapper includes support for inflating/deflating memory buffers,
.Net streaming wrappers for the gz streams part of zlib, and wrappers
for the checksum parts of zlib. See DotZLib/UnitTests.cs for examples.

Directory structure:
--------------------

LICENSE_1_0.txt       - License file.
readme.txt            - This file.
DotZLib.chm           - Class library documentation
DotZLib.build         - NAnt build file
DotZLib.sln           - Microsoft Visual Studio 2003 solution file

DotZLib\*.cs          - Source files for the class library

Unit tests:
-----------
The file DotZLib/UnitTests.cs contains unit tests for use with NUnit 2.1 or higher.
To include unit tests in the build, define nunit before building.


Build instructions:
-------------------

1. Using Visual Studio.Net 2003:
   Open DotZLib.sln in VS.Net and build from there. Output file (DotZLib.dll)
   will be found ./DotZLib/bin/release or ./DotZLib/bin/debug, depending on
   you are building the release or debug version of the library. Check
   DotZLib/UnitTests.cs for instructions on how to include unit tests in the
   build.

2. Using NAnt:
   Open a command prompt with access to the build environment and run nant
   in the same directory as the DotZLib.build file.
   You can define 2 properties on the nant command-line to control the build:
   debug={true|false} to toggle between release/debug builds (default=true).
   nunit={true|false} to include or esclude unit tests (default=true).
   Also the target clean will remove binaries.
   Output file (DotZLib.dll) will be found in either ./DotZLib/bin/release
   or ./DotZLib/bin/debug, depending on whether you are building the release
   or debug version of the library.

   Examples:
     nant -D:debug=false -D:nunit=false
       will build a release mode version of the library without unit tests.
     nant
       will build a debug version of the library with unit tests
     nant clean
       will remove all previously built files.

zlib/contrib/pascal/readme.txt


This directory contains a Pascal (Delphi, Kylix) interface to the
zlib data compression library.


Directory listing
=================

zlibd32.mak     makefile for Borland C++
example.pas     usage example of zlib
zlibpas.pas     the Pascal interface to zlib
readme.txt      this file


Compatibility notes
===================

- Although the name "zlib" would have been more normal for the
  zlibpas unit, this name is already taken by Borland's ZLib unit.
  This is somehow unfortunate, because that unit is not a genuine
  interface to the full-fledged zlib functionality, but a suite of
  class wrappers around zlib streams.  Other essential features,
  such as checksums, are missing.
  It would have been more appropriate for that unit to have a name
  like "ZStreams", or something similar.

- The C and zlib-supplied types int, uInt, long, uLong, etc. are
  translated directly into Pascal types of similar sizes (Integer,
  LongInt, etc.), to avoid namespace pollution.  In particular,
  there is no conversion of unsigned int into a Pascal unsigned
  integer.  The Word type is non-portable and has the same size
  (16 bits) both in a 16-bit and in a 32-bit environment, unlike
  Integer.  Even if there is a 32-bit Cardinal type, there is no
  real need for unsigned int in zlib under a 32-bit environment.

- Except for the callbacks, the zlib function interfaces are
  assuming the calling convention normally used in Pascal
  (__pascal for DOS and Windows16, __fastcall for Windows32).
  Since the cdecl keyword is used, the old Turbo Pascal does
  not work with this interface.

- The gz* function interfaces are not translated, to avoid
  interfacing problems with the C runtime library.  Besides,
    gzprintf(gzFile file, const char *format, ...)
  cannot be translated into Pascal.

 tif_overview.c,v 1.9 2005/05/25 09:03:16 dron Exp

 Project:  TIFF Overview Builder
 Purpose:  Library function for building overviews in a TIFF file.
 Author:   Frank Warmerdam, warmerdam@pobox.com

 Notes:
  o Currently only images with bits_per_sample of a multiple of eight
    will work.

  o The downsampler currently just takes the top left pixel from the
    source rectangle.  Eventually sampling options of averaging, mode, and
    ``center pixel'' should be offered.

  o The code will attempt to use the same kind of compression,
    photometric interpretation, and organization as the source image, but
    it doesn't copy geotiff tags to the reduced resolution images.

  o Reduced resolution overviews for multi-sample files will currently
    always be generated as PLANARCONFIG_SEPARATE.  This could be fixed
    reasonable easily if needed to improve compatibility with other
    packages.  Many don't properly support PLANARCONFIG_SEPARATE.

The following is used to transform a named color value at a particular tint
value to the output device values.  This function is provided only as a
demonstration and will likely need to be altered and optimized for those wishing
to perform full spot color look-up support.

The object used to perform the transformation is typically
a look-up table that contains the spot color name and a CIELAB value for
100% colorant (it could also contain device values in the table).
It can be more complex where-by you have a 1-D lut that
provides CIELAB values or direct device values as a function of tint.  In
such a case, the table would be interpolated to compute all possible tint values.
If CIELAB values are provided, they can be pushed through the
device profile using the CMM.  In this particular demonstration, we simply
provide CIELAB for a few color names in the file
toolbin/color/named_color/named_color_table.txt .
The tint value is used to scale the CIELAB value from 100% colorant to a D50
whitepoint.  The resulting CIELAB value is then pushed through the CMM to
obtain device values for the current device.  The file named_colors.pdf
which is in toolbin/color/named_color/ contains these
spot colors and will enable the user to see how the code behaves.  The named
color table is specified to ghostscript by the command line option
-sNamedProfile=./toolbin/color/named_color/named_color_table.txt (or with
full path name).  If it is desired to have ghostscript compiled with the
named color table, it can be placed in the iccprofiles directory and then
build ghostscript with COMPILE_INITS=1.  When specified the file contents
are pointed to by the buffer member variable of the device_named profile in
profile manager.  When the first call occurs in here, the contents of the
buffer are parsed and placed into a custom stucture that is pointed to by
the profile pointer.  Note that this pointer is not visible to the garbage
collector and should be allocated in non-gc memory as is demonstrated in
this sample.  The structure elements are released when the profile is
destroyed through the call to gsicc_named_profile_release, which is set
as the value of the profile member variable release.

Note that there are calls defined in gsicc_littlecms.c that will create link
transforms between Named Color ICC profiles and the output device.  Such
profiles are rarely used (at least I have not run across any yet) so the
code is currently not used.  Also note that for those serious about named
color support, a cache as well as efficient table-look-up methods would
likely be important for performance.

Finally note that PANTONE is a registered trademark and PANTONE colors are a
licensed product of XRITE Inc. See http://www.pantone.com
for more information.  Licensees of Pantone color libraries or similar
libraries should find it straight forward to interface.  Pantone names are
referred to in named_color_table.txt and contained in the file named_colors.pdf.

!!!!IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO PERFORM THE PROPER DEALLOCATION
    CLEAN-UP OF THE STRUCTURES WHEN rc_free_icc_profile OCCURS FOR THE NAMED
    COLOR PROFILE!!!!!!   See gsicc_named_profile_release below for an example.
    This is set in the profile release member variable.

base/gsicc_create.c

   This is the code that is used to convert the various PDF and PS CIE
   based color spaces to ICC profiles.  This enables the use of an
   external CMS that is ICC centric to be used for ALL color management.

   The following spaces are handled:

   From PDF

   % Input Spaces

   CalRGB      -->  ICC 1-D LUTS and Matrix
   CalGray     -->  ICC 1-D LUT
   LAB         -->  ICC MLUT with a 2x2 sized table

   From PS

   %% Input Spaces

   CIEBasedABC  --> ICC 1-D LUTs and Matrix
   CIEBasedA    --> ICC 1-D LUT
   CIEBasedDEF  --> 3-D MLUT plus 1-D LUTs
   CIEBasedDEFG --> 4-D MLUT pluse 1-D LUTs

   %% Output Spaces

   Type1 CRD -->  ICC will have MLUT if render table present.

   A few notes:

   Required Tags for ALL profiles include:

       profileDescriptionTag
       copyrightTag
       mediaWhatePointTag
       chromaticAdaptationTag (V4 -  when measurement data is for other than D50)

   For color input profiles:

       Required if N-component LUT-based:

## Files:
base/gsncdummy.c

This module has been created to demonstrate how to support the use of
PANTONE colors to the Ghostscript graphics library.  PANTONE colors
are specified in both PostScript and PDF files via the use of DeviceN
or Separation color spaces.

PANTONE is a registered trademark and PANTONE colors are a
licensed product of Pantone Inc. See http://www.pantone.com
for more information.

See the comments at the start of src/gsnamecl.c for description of the
client color processing routines.

Since this is only a 'demo' implementation, the example implementation does
not have some features which might be expected in a 'real' implementation.

1.  The Pantone color data table does not have actual entries for all
    of the different Pantone colors.  This data is not included since
    the values are dependent upon specific details of the output device,
    inks, etc.
2.  Colors in PostScript and PDF are specified with by values between
    0 and 1.  The output colorant values are scaled linearly.
3.  DeviceN color spaces can specify multiple colors.  However this
    implementation assumes that if a PANTONE color is specified in a
    DeviceN color space, then only PANTONE colors or CMYK are present.
    This was done to keep the code simple.  If other colors are present,
    then this implementation falls back to using the alternate color space
    specified with the DeviceN color space.  (This is the normal PS
    and PDF operation.)

See also src/zsncdummy.c for an example custom color callback.

One way we can arrive here is from gs_copy_font() -> z42_font_info(), in
that case we definitely want to copy the copyright informatoin if there is any,
but we don't want to throw an error if we find a Type 42 font which has no
copyright information. So get the informaton, but ignore the return code.

This is useful to avoid conflicts at link time between functions
from different sources but with the same name.  As a convention,
all FreeType internal functions names are prefixed with the two
letters "FT" by this file.

Note that this file doesn't change the names of FreeType's

TODO:

- Fix the non-square pixel case (or how to manage the CVT to
  detect horizontal and vertical scaled FUnits ?)


Changes between 2.3 and 2.2:

- added support for rotation, stretching, instruction control

- added support for non-square pixels.  However, this doesn't
  work perfectly yet...

Changes between 2.2 and 2.1:

- a small bugfix in the Push opcodes

Changes between 2.1 and 2.0:

- created the TTExec component to take care of all execution
  context management.  The interpreter has now one single
  function.

- made some changes to support re-entrancy.  The re-entrant
  interpreter is smaller!

contrib/gdevhl12.c

This driver handles the 1200x600 dpi mode, and some settings like
paper source and toner save mode.  600x600 dpi and below is handled
by gdevdljm.c (basically as in the ljet4 device, with minor changes
in initialization and margins, and PCL wrapped in PJL).

There are two device names made available by this driver, which
differ only in the default (maximum) resolution:

  -sDEVICE=hl1240
     600x600 dpi, for HL-1030/1240 (uses standard PCL modes 2 and 3)

  -sDEVICE=hl1250
     1200x600 dpi, for HL-1050/1070/1250/1270N
     (uses special compression mode 1027 for 1200x600 dpi,
     otherwise modes 2 and 3 as above)

Tested with a HL-1250, both 1200x600 and 600x600 dpi.  Please test
with other models and report results (both problems and success).
Some notes on the other models:

  HL-1070 and HL-1270N
     can also print Postscript directly, at maximum 600x600 dpi
     (this driver can print 1200x600 dpi using mode 1027).

  HL-1240
     should no longer be limited to 300 dpi - this driver sends
     the recommended "@PJL SET RESOLUTION=..." command.  PLEASE TEST.
     There have been some vague problem reports (wrong margins? not
     clear for what paper size, quite possibly Letter, not A4?) with
     this printer, if you have it and some Ghostscript hacking skills,
     _please_ try to help, fix it and send me a patch - thanks!

  HL-1030
     should no longer be "Paperweight" despite the "for Windows only"
     warning :-) - it knows enough PCL to print raster graphics, but
     *requires* "@PJL ENTER LANGUAGE=PCL", so it does not work with
     the ljet4 driver sending raw PCL.  The windows driver uses an
     undocumented compression mode 1030, but modes 2 and 3 work too.
     PLEASE TEST.

New models, still need to be tested:
  HL-1230 (GDI printer)
  HL-1440 (GDI printer)
  HL-1450 (PCL6 and PS2 emulation)
  HL-1470N (PCL6 and PS2 emulation)

Additional settings (gs command line options) for this driver:

  -dEconoMode=0...2
     toner save mode: 0 = disabled (default), 1 = 25%, 2 = 50%

  -dPaperType=0...4
     paper type: 0 = plain (default), 1 = thin, 2 = thick, 3 = thicker,
     4 = transparency

  -dSourceTray=0...4
     paper source: 0 = auto (default), 1 = dual, 2 = upper, 3 = lower,
     4 = manual (not all models support the optional lower tray)

The 1200x600 dpi mode may require a lot of printer memory - the manual
recommends at least 10 MB; for me it seems to work well with 8 MB: 4 MB
standard + 4 MB "finally found some good use for that old PS/2 SIMM" :-).
Even at just 600x600 dpi (normal PCL 5 control codes) print quality is
very good, at 1200x600 dpi it is difficult to see the difference (more
visible on grayscale images).  So 600x600 dpi is best for general use.

The HL-1250 also supports PCL 6 (PCL XL) but
- I don't have the documentation for that
- the pxlmono driver works, but the output looks a bit different
  from that generated by the ljet4 or (this) 1200x600 dpi driver
  (lines appear very thin - not yet sure if this is a driver bug
  or differences in PCL 6 implementation, someone should check on
  a HP printer, does tiger.ps printed using the ljet4 and pxlmono
  drivers, both at 600x600 dpi, look the same?)
so let's use the good old ljet4 (PCL 5) driver for now.
(PCL 6 seems to offer better compression though.)

To do: the undocumented mode 1030 may offer better compression
(may help print complex graphics at 600 dpi - the HL-1030/1240 have
only 2 MB of non-expandable RAM, which may not be enough for data
that doesn't compress well).  The windows driver uses this mode for
all models, not just HL-1030.  Documentation may be available later.

Many thanks to Richard Thomas <richardt@brother.co.uk> for help
(sending me a HL-1250, documentation, answering my questions).

Thanks to L. Peter Deutsch <ghost@aladdin.com> for making gdevdjet.c
and gdevdljm.[ch] available under a dual AFPL/GPL license.

Operation: The page bitmap is scanned to determined the
actual margins.  A "graphics rectangle" is defined to
contain the included data and positioned on the page.
The bitmap is then re-read and "sixellized" by converting
each three bytes to four six-bit chunks (zero padding on
the right if necessary) and adding x'3F' to generate a
printable code.  Runs of up to 32767 identical characters
are compressed to an ascii count and a single character.

        Otherwise it will be stored in the eprn device. Note that

    EPRN_NO_PAGECOUNTFILE
        Define this if you do not want to use eprn's pagecount-file feature.
        You very likely must define this on Microsoft Windows. This is
        automatically defined under Visual Studio builds.

    EPRN_TRAILING_BIT_BUG_FIXED
        Define this to deactivate compensation for a bug in ghostscript which
        leads to the last pixel in an RGB line being black instead of white.
        This occurs at least in gs 6.01 and 6.50. The correction covers only
        the one-bit-per-colorant case and is equivalent to clipping the pixel.

*******************************************************************************

  The eprn device uses 'gx_color_index' values with varying interpretations,
  depending on the colour model and the rendering method, and stores them at
  different pixmaps depths, normally using the smallest depth which can
  accommodate all colorants at the same number of bits per colorant.

  To simplify matters, a field for the black component is always included, even
  for RGB and CMY, i.e., there are either 1 or 4 bit fields in a
  'gx_color_index' value. If there are 4, the interpretation is either YMCK or
  BGRK, looking from left to right (most to least significant). The width of
  the fields can be found in the 'bits_per_colorant' variable in the eprn part
  of the device instance.

  Within each colorant field, not all bits need be used. Except when using the
  *_max() colour mapping functions, the values returned by
  eprn_bits_for_levels() for the parameters 'black_levels' and
  'non_black_levels' determine the number of bits which are actually
  meaningful. Only the last (least significant) bits are used.

  The 'eprn' device
  *****************
  In developing my hpdj/pcl3 driver for PCL 3+ I had to implement a lot of
  functionality which was logically independent of PCL. This indicated that the
  functionality offered by ghostscript's 'prn' device was insufficient and
  should be extended, leading to this "extended prn device".

  Functionality
  =============
  The "eprn" device offers the following services to derived devices:
  - A simple but still flexible rendering model. A derived device defines
    printer capability descriptions listing the supported rendering parameters,
    lets the eprn device handle the user's rendering requests, and then just
    fetches the pixels.
  - A PostScript-conforming initialization of default user space with respect
    to landscape orientation and support for the standard page device parameter
    "LeadingEdge".
  - Recognition of media sizes from the document and checking of supported
    sizes based on printer descriptions
  - Flexible handling of size-specific hardware margins
  - Counting of pages printed across gs invocations by means of page count
    files

  Rendering Model
  ===============
  The "eprn" device parameterizes the printer's rendering capabilities as
  follows:
  - process colour model (Gray, RGB, CMY, CMY+K, CMYK)
  - resolution in horizontal and vertical directions
  - number of intensity levels per colorant, chosen independently for black
    and non-black (RGB or CMY) colorants.
  In addition, the rendering process as implemented in this driver is
  parameterized by:
  - method for rendering intensities (printer, halftones or error diffusion)
  These parameters are specified by the user. The device checks whether the
  printer supports the requested combination and, if it does, sets
  ghostscript's internal data structures accordingly.

  The derived device can obtain the resulting pixels by successively calling
  eprn_get_planes() from the page printing procedure.

  Device Coordinates
  ==================
  "Pixmap device space" is the coordinate system used by the "prn" device for
  generating a pixmap and implicit in the API for accessing it (e.g.,
  gdev_prn_copy_scan_lines()). In identifying the directions "left", "bottom",
  "right" and "top" I'm assuming that the x axis is pointing to the right and
  the y axis downwards. This is not concerned with the orientation of device
  space on a sheet printed but is merely a definition of what, e.g., "down"
  means for the eprn device: it is defined as "towards increasing prn y values".
  This makes the code more readable for the case where the real device
  coordinate system (on the sheet) has just this orientation. Too bad for the
  others :-).

  Terms like "width" and "height" are also defined with respect to this
  interpretation, i.e., "width" is an extension in x direction.

  Note that names and interpretations of some of ghostscript's standard
  device structure fields (like 'width', 'height') are also based on this
  convention although this is not explicitly stated. This does however not
  apply to all parameters: for example, HWMargins[] and MediaSize[] are to be
  interpreted in default user space (see gx_default_clip_box()).

  One key assumption of the eprn device is that the top edge of pixmap device
  space is the edge closest to and parallel with the medium's leading edge.
  It is the responsibility of the derived device to ensure this. Usually
  it means that raster lines have to be printed in the order of ascending y.
  (The eprn device will work if the derived device violates this condition, but
  the meaning of user-visible properties of the device would change.)

  The device sets up the device coordinate system such that the device space
  origin is the top left corner of the imageable area where "top" and "left"
  refer to you holding the sheet with the printed side towards you and the
  leading edge at the top. Units and directions are identical with pixmap
  device space.

  Page Descriptions
  =================
  When a PostScript document requests a particular page size by specifying its
  width and height in default user space the eprn device combines this
  information with certain conditions imposed by the derived device and looks
  for a matching page description entry in the printer's capability
  description. The following information from such an entry is needed for
  correctly setting up the relation between default user space and device space:

    - default orientation of the sheet in pixmap device space
      (MS_TRANSVERSE_FLAG; set iff the sheet has width > height in pixmap
      device space)
    - hardware margins

  This part is interpreted by the eprn device.

  In addition, a page description entry may contain a number of flags
  indicating special conditions under which this entry is to be selected or
  carrying information on how to configure the printer. The flags are those
  defined by mediasize.h (except that MS_TRANSVERSE_FLAG and MS_ROTATED_FLAG
  may not be used for this purpose), their interpretation is up to the derived
  device which must request them or to which they will become visible when the
  entry is selected.

  The eprn device takes the following items as the request to be matched with a
  page description entry in the printer's capability description:

    - the media size of the document and, if set, the "LeadingEdge" page device
      parameter
    - a pattern of desired (not necessarily *required*) flags
    - an ordered list of optional flags

  Media size and LeadingEdge are set via PostScript or the command line, the
  flags can be set by the derived device through its device structure instance
  or by calling eprn_set_media_flags(). The optional flags when combined with
  the bitwise OR effectively define a mask of bits which may be ignored when
  checking whether an entry matches the desired flags. The order of optional
  flags is from most to least desirable to ignore.

  The complete request is compared to the list of page descriptions as follows:

   1. If the media size, irrespective of flags, cannot be matched at 5 bp
      tolerance, the request fails with an error message to standard error.
   2. Otherwise a shortened list containing all entries having a matching
      size is compiled, at least conceptually. If the device supports custom
      page sizes, they are listed at the end. This is the "base list".
   3. If LeadingEdge is not null, the MS_TRANSVERSE_FLAG is set or cleared
      accordingly in the pattern of desired flags. This flag is also always
      added to the front of the list of optional flags.
   4. A mask of flags to be ignored is set to zero.
   5. The base list is searched for an entry agreeing with the desired flags
      except possibly for those in the ignore mask.
   6. If no such entry is found, the next flag in the list of optional flags is
      added to the ignore mask and execution continues with step 5. If there is
      no such flag, the request fails and the flag mismatch reporting function
      is called (see below).
   7. If a matching entry is found the list of optional flags is processed
      backwards starting with the flag before the last one added to the ignore
      mask. For each such flag an attempt is made to remove it from the mask.
      If there still is at least one matching entry in the base list the flag
      remains cleared, otherwise it is put back into the mask.
   8. Finally, the first entry matching the request mask and the current
      ignore mask will be selected:
      - its media code will be made available to the derived device in the
        eprn device's 'code' field,
      - the hardware margins will be set from the page description (unless the
        user has explicitly specified a value for the ".HWMargins" page device
        parameter),
      - default user space will be configured based on sheet orientation
        (transverse or not in device space) and page orientation (portrait or
        landscape in default user space).

  Because the error message in step 6 has to report a mismatch on the flags
  and because the interpretation of the flags is fixed by the derived device,
  an error message issued by the eprn device may not be particularly
  illuminating to the user (the user will usually think in terms of the
  interpretation the derived device associates with these flags). Therefore
  issuing this error message can be delegated to a function ("flag mismatch
  reporting function") specified by the derived device in its device structure
  instance.

  In the implementation of these and other functions I have mainly used the
  following documents:

  - Hewlett-Packard
    "Technical Reference Guide for the HP DeskJet 500 Series Printers"
    First edition, October 1994
    Manual Part Number: C2170-90099
    (Quoted as "TRG500")
  - Hewlett-Packard
    "Hewlett-Packard 300 and 400 Series DeskJet Printers - Software Developer's
      Guide"
    January 1996
    (Quoted as "DJ3/4")
  - Hewlett-Packard
    "HP DeskJet 600/800 Series Printers - Software Developer's PCL Guide"
    Fifth edition, October 1997
    (Quoted as "DJ6/8")
  - Hewlett-Packard
    "DeskJet 1120C Printer - Software Developer's PCL Guide"
    First printing, December 1997. Version 1.0.
    (Quoted as "DJ1120C")
  - Hewlett-Packard
    "Printer Job Language Technical Reference Manual"
    Edition 10, October 1997. HP Part No. 5021-0380.
    (Quoted as "PJLTRM")
  - Lexmark
    "Printer Technical Reference, Version 1.1"
    First edition, February 1999
    (Quoted as "Lexmark-PTR". It deals with PCL 5 and PCL 6.)

  In addition, some other documents are quoted in a form like "BPD02926". These
  were obtained from http://www.hp.com, usually from the directory
  cposupport/printers/support_doc. BPD02926, for example, (a short description
  of PCL commands for series-800 DeskJets) could be found as the file
  bpd02926.html in that directory.

demos/python/gsapi.py

Python version of the C API in psi/iapi.h.

Copyright (C) 2001-2023 Artifex Software, Inc.

Overview:

    Implemented using Python's ctypes module.

    All functions have the same name as the C function that they wrap.

    Functions raise a GSError exception if the underlying function returned a
    negative error code.

    Functions that don't have out-params return None. Out-params are returned
    directly (using tuples if there are more than one).

    See examples.py for sample usage.

Example usage:

    On Linux/OpenBSD/MacOS:
        Build the ghostscript shared library:
            make sodebug

        Run gsapi.py as a test script:
            GSAPI_LIBDIR=sodebugbin ./demos/python/gsapi.py

    On Windows:
        Build ghostscript dll, for example:
            devenv.com windows/GhostPDL.sln /Build Debug /Project ghostscript

        Run gsapi.py as a test script in a cmd.exe window:
            set GSAPI_LIBDIR=debugbin&& python ./demos/python/gsapi.py

        Run gsapi.py as a test script in a PowerShell window:
            cmd /C "set GSAPI_LIBDIR=debugbin&& python ./demos/python/gsapi.py"

Specifying the Ghostscript shared library:

    Two environmental variables can be used to specify where to find the
    Ghostscript shared library.

    GSAPI_LIB sets the exact path of the ghostscript shared library, else
    GSAPI_LIBDIR sets the directory containing the ghostscript shared
    library. If neither is defined we will use the OS's default location(s) for
    shared libraries.

    If GSAPI_LIB is not defined, the leafname of the shared library is inferred
    from the OS type - libgs.so on Unix, libgs.dylib on MacOS, gsdll64.dll on
    Windows 64.

Requirements:

    Should work on python-2.5+ and python-3.0+, but this might change in
    future.

Limitations as of 2020-07-21:

    Only very limited testing on has been done.

    Tested on Linux, OpenBSD and Windows.

    Only tested with python-3.7 and 2.7.

    We don't provide gsapi_add_fs() or gsapi_remove_fs().

    We only provide display_callback V2, without V3's
    display_adjust_band_height and display_rectangle_request.

but assigned to Artifex Software, Inc. (see http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=692665)

output is plain text; one line per page.
columns 1 through 4 give the fraction of pixels containing
c, m, y and black ink.
column 5 is the string 'CMYK'.
column 6 is 'OK' if everything went fine, 'ERROR' if there
was a problem.

the resolution defaults to 75 dpi (which gives good-enough estimates)
but can be changed via the -r flag to Ghostscript.

IJS device for Ghostscript.
Intended to work with any IJS compliant inkjet driver, including
hpijs 1.0 and later, an IJS-enhanced gimp-print driver, and
the IJS Windows GDI server (ijsmswin.exe).

DRAFT

WARNING: The ijs server can be selected on the gs command line
which is a security risk, since any program can be run.
You should use -dSAFER which sets .LockSafetyParams to true
before opening this device.

11/26/03 David Suffield (gdevijs-krgb-1.0.patch)
(c) 2003-2004 Copyright Hewlett-Packard Development Company, LP

1. Removed hpijs 1.0-1.0.2 workarounds, use hpijs 1.0.3 or higher.
2. Added krgb support.

02/21/05 David Suffield (gdevijs-krgb-1.1.patch)
1. Fixed segfault issue with 1-bit color space.
2. Fixed z-order issue with colored text on black rectangle.

02/22/06 David Suffield (gdevijs-krgb-1.2.patch)
1. Fixed krgb buffer overflow issue with out-of-band data in fill_rectangle and copy_mono.
   This buffer overflow condition occurred with fullbleed print jobs that had k-band images.
2. Added Dan Coby (artifex) fix for gsijs_read_string_malloc gs_free *str memory leak.

06/02/06 David Suffield (gdevijs-krgb-1.3.patch)
1. Revisited the krgb buffer overflow issue with out-of-band data in fill_rectangle and
   copy_mono. Changed the fill_rectangle and copy_mono to an inner loop buffer check
   instead of a outer loop x/y extent check.
2. As requested by Ralph Giles, added K 1-bit and 8-bit support for krgb, but only 1-bit is
   implemented for now.

   KRGB definition:
   1. K=1-bit or 8-bit black plane, RGB=24 bit color raster.
   2. K-plane will only contain objects that are black text and black line drawings.
   3. RGB raster will not contain K-plane objects.
   4. K resolution and RGB resolution will be equal.
   5. K-plane will be byte aligned.
   6. K-plane 1-bit definition; 1=black, 0=nothing (KRGB).
   7. K-plane 8-bit definition; 255=black, 0=nothing (KxRGB).

1/15/08 David Suffield (gdevijs-krgb-1.5.patch)
1. Added checks for null forward device in the graphic procedures.
2. Corrected the "force banding" code in gsijs_open. Needed for small images (IE: hagaki in landscape).

HISTORY
~~~~~~~

8 June 1999 Zolt�n K�csi (aka Kocsonya) zoltan@bendor.com.au

        Initial revision.
        No shingling, depletion.
        Colour only.
        Dither matrix is blatantly copied from gslib.c.

17 April 2000 Zolt�n K�csi

        After much play worked out a reasonably simple colour mapping
        that gives fairly good results. It has some very hairy things
        in it but ot seems to work reasonably well on a variety of natural
        as well as artificial images.

CREDIT
~~~~~~
This driver was written from scratch, however, I have used the
HP/BJ driver very heavily as a reference (GhostScript's documentation
needs some working :-). In addition, I got some help in understanding
the more arcane features of the printer by digging into the colour
Epson driver and its documentation (documentation for the Photo EX
did not exist). I thank to the authors of these drivers and the
related docs.

I do also hereby express my despising Epson, Inc. who try to enlarge
Microsoft's monopoly by witholding programming information about such
a commodity item as a printer.

KNOWN BUGS/LIMITATIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Monochrome driver is not finished yet
- The driver is not optimised for speed
- The driver does not support TIFF compression
- Shingling and depletion is not implemented
- The colour correction and ink transfer curve are hardcoded
- The dither matrix is straight stolen from Ghostscript
- The alternative error diffusion included but does not work (yet)

I plan to attend these issues later, however, I don't promise any timeframe
for I have a lot else to do for bread & butter too.

PREFACE
~~~~~~~
The Epson Stylus Photo EX is a colour ink-jet printer.
It can handle papers up to A3. It uses 6 inks, black in one cartridge
and cyan, magenta, yellow, light cyan and light magenta in an other
cartridge. The head has 32 nozzles, with 1/90" spacing.
The maximal resolution is 1440 dpi horizontal 720 dpi vertical.
In 720x720 and 360x360 dpi it supports microweave. To achieve
1440x720 you must use software weaving. It has only one built-in font,
namely 12pt Courier; the printer in general havily relies on the
driver software. It comes with (what else ?) Windows 9x and Mac drivers.

The printer uses the ESC/P Raster protocol. This protocol is somewhat
similar to the ESC/P2 one. Initially Epson refused to give any info
about it. Later (unfortunately after I had already spent lot of time
to reverse engineer it) they released its definition. It could be
found on their website (http://www.ercipd.com/isv/level1/6clr_98b.pdf).
Alas, they removed it, so at the moment I do not know about any existing
docs of the printer.
There are still a few commands which are not covered by the docs
and for example the Windows driver uses them. There are others which
are in the docs, saying that you can find them in other docs but you
can't. Fortunately, these commands apparently have no effect on the
printing process so this driver simply ignores them. Tricky business.

By the way, my personal experience is that Epson tech support is
a joke, or in Usenet lingvo it sucks big time - they know absolutely
nothing about the product they supposed to support. Epson's webpage
contains false info as well (they state that the Photo EX uses ESC/P2,
which is simply not true).

This driver should in theory support the Stylus 700 and the Stylus Photo
as well but I have not tested it on them.

If you think that you can get some useful info from me above of what you
can find below, feel free to email me at zoltan@bendor.com.au.
If you enhance the driver or find a bug *please* send me info about
it.

DRIVER
~~~~~~
The driver was written under Ghostscript 5.10.
This file should contain two drivers, one for colour mode and one for B&W.
The devices are "photoex" and "photoexm". The mono device driver is
catered for (that is, the rendering part knows how to render for B&W)
but it is not finished yet (no device structure and gray colour mapping
procedures) mainly because all my B&W needs are fairly well satisfied
by our laser printer.

The driver features the following:

Supported resolutions

         360x360	Y weaving (not that micro :-) by the printer
         720x720	Y microweave by the driver (quicker than the printer)
        1440x720	Y and X microweave by the driver

        Resolutions other than these will result in a rangecheck error.

Papersize:

        Whatever Ghostscript supports. The printer docs say that if you load
        multiple sheets of transparencies into the tray you should at least
        have 30mm or 1.2" top margin. The driver always sets the smallest
        possible top margin (3mm or 0.12"), it's up to you to comply.

        In addition, the printer says that the bottom margin is at least
        14mm or 0.54". I violate it by setting it to 0.5" or 12.7mm.
        0.5" seems to be a common margin value for documents and you
        would hate it when the last line of your page gets printed on the
        top of the next sheet ...

Options:

        -dDotSize=n

                n = 0		Let the driver choose a dotsize
                n = 1		small dots
                n = 2		more ink
                n = 3		ink flood
                n = 4		'super microdots' (whatever they are, they are *big*)

                The default is 0 which is n=1 for 1440x720, 2 for 720x720 and
                3 for 360x360. Do not use large dots if you don't have to, you
                will soak the paper. If you print 720x720 on normal paper, try
                using n=1.

        -dRender=n

                n = 0		Floyd-Steinbeck error diffusion
                n = 1		Clustered dither
                n = 2		Bendor's error diffusion (experimental, do not use)

                Default is Floyd-Steinbeck error diffusion

        -dLeakage=nn

                nn is between 0 and 25. It only effects Bendor's error diffusion.
                It sets the percentage of the error which is left to 'leak', that
                is it is the coefficient of an exponential decay of the error.
                Experiments show that it can be beneficial on image quality.
                Default is 0 (no leakage).

        -dSplash=nn

                nn is between 0 and 100. It only affects Bendor's error diffusion.
                The ED routine tries to take the increase of dot diameter on certain
                paper types into account.
                It sets the percentage of the ink dot size increase as it splashes
                onto the paper and spreads. 0 means no splashing, 100 means that
                the dot is twice as large as it should be.
                Default is 0.

        -dBinhibit=n

                If n is 1, then if black ink is deposited to a pixel, it will
                inhibit the deposition of any other ink to the same pixel.
                If 0, black ink may be deposited together with other inks.
                Default is on (1).

ESC/P RASTER DOCS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The parts of the ESC/P Raster protocol which I've managed to decipher,
and which are actually used in this driver can be found below.
nn, mm, xx, etc. represent a single byte with a binary value in it.
nnnn, xxxx etc. represent a 16-bit binary number, sent in two bytes,
in little endian order (low byte first). 2-digit numbers are a single
byte in hex. Other chars are themselves.
Quite a few commands are identical to the ESC/P2 commands, these are
marked with (P2).

ESC @								(P2)

        Resets the printer.

ESC ( U 01 00 nn					(P2)

        Sets the unit to 3600/nn dpi. Note that 1440 can not be set !

ESC ( C 02 00 nnnn					(P2)

        Sets the page (paper) length to nnnn units

ESC ( c 04 00 bbbb tttt				(P2)

        Sets the top margin to tttt units, the bottom margin to
        bbbb units. The bottom margin is measured from the top
        of the page not from the bottom of the page !

ESC	U nn							(P2)

        Unidirectional printing

        nn
        00	off
        01	on

        31	on	(this is ASCII 1)

ESC	( i 01 00 nn					(P2)

        Microweave

        nn
        00	off
        01	on
        30	off (this is ASCII 0)
        31	on	(this is ASCII 1)

        Turns microweave on for 720x720 dpi printing.

ESC r nn							(P2)

        Select colour

        30		Off
        31		On

ESC ( v 02 00 dddd					(P2)

        Advance the paper by dddd units defined by ESC ( U

ESC . cc vv hh nn mmmm <data>		(P2)

        Sends graphics data to the printer.

        cc	Encoding mode

                00	Raw data
                01	Run-length encoded data

        vv	Vertical resolution

                28	  90 dpi	*interleave*
                14	 180 dpi	*interleave*
                0a	 360 dpi
                05	 720 dpi

        hh	Horizontal resolution

                0a	 360 dpi
                05	 720 dpi

        nn	Number of nozzles

                It should be set to 32 (normal printing) or 1 (microweave)

        mmmm Number of collumns of data (not number of data bytes !)

        <data>

                The data should contain as many bytes as needed to fill the
                mmmm * nn pixels. Data is presented horizontally, that is,
                the bits of a byte will be represented by eight pixels in
                a row. If the number of collumns is not an integer multiple
                of eight, then some bits from the last byte belonging to the
                row will be discarded and the next row starts on a byte boundary.
                If a bit in a byte is '1' ink is deposited, if '0' not.
                The leftmost pixel is represented by the MSB, rightmost by LSB.
                In case of raw data that's about it.

                In case of run-length encoded data, the following is done:
                The first byte is a counter. If the counter is <= 127 then
                the following counter+1 bytes are uncompressed data.
                If the counter is >= 128 then the following single byte should
                be repeated 257-counter times.

        There are resolution restrictions:

                360x360 nozzle= 1 microweave on
                360x360 nozzle=32 microweave off
                720x 90 nozzle=32 microweave off
                720x720	nozzle= 1 microweave on

        Other combinations are not supported.

ESC ( e 02 00 00 nn

        Sets the amount of ink spat onto the paper.

        nn
        01		microdots (faint printing)
        02		normal dots (not so faint printing)
        03		double dots (full inking)
        04		super microdots (ink is continuously dripping :-)

        Values other than that have apparently no effect.

ESC ( K 02 00 xxxx

        This command is sent by the Windows driver but it is not used
        in the Epson test images. I have not found it having any effect
        whatsoever. The driver does not use it. The Epson docs don't
        mention it.

ESC ( r 02 00 nn mm

        Selects the ink according to this:

        nn mm
        00 00	black
        00 01	magenta
        00 02	cyan
        00 04	yellow
        01 01	light magenta
        01 02	light yellow

ESC ( \ 04 00 xxxx llll

        Horizontal positioning of the head.

        Moves the head to the position llll times 1/xxxx inches from
        the left margin.
        On the example images xxxx was always set to 1440.
        I tried other values in which case the command was ignored,
        so stick to 1440.

ESC ( R ll 00 00 <text> <cc> xxxx nn .. nn
ESC 00 00 00

        This is supposedly sets the printer into 'remote' mode.
        ll is the length of the <text> + 1 which consists of ASCII
        characters (e.g. REMOTE1).
        <cc> is a two-character code, for example "SN" or "LD".
        xxxx is the number of bytes (nn -s) which will follow.
        After that there's either a new <cc> xxxx nn .. nn sequence or
        the ESC 00 00 00.
        I have absolutely no idea about this command and the Epson document
        says that it's in an other document. It's not in that other one.
        The driver does not use it. The printer does not miss it.
        The Epson test images use it and the Windows driver uses it too.
        They send different <cc>-s and different values for identical <cc>-s.
        Go figure.

DRIVER INTERNALS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
First, some comments.
Anything I know about the printer can be found above.
Anything I know about Ghostscript internals (not much) can be
found in the comments in the code. I do not believe in the 'it was hard
to write, it should be hard to read' principle since I once had to
understand my own code.
Therefore, the code has lots of comments in it, sometimes apparently
superfluous but I find it easier to understand the program 6 months
later that way.
I did not follow the Ghostscript or GNU style guide, I write code the way
I like it - I'm a lazy dog :-) I use hard tabs at every 4th position,
I use a *lot* of whitespace (as recommended by K&R in their original
C book) and I have a formatting style similar to the K&R with the
notable exception that I do not indent variable declarations that follow
the curly. Anyway, you can run your favourite C formatter through the
source.

In addition to the above, the driver is not hand-optimised, it assumes
that it is compiled with a good optimising compiler which will handle
common subexpression ellimination, move loop independent code out of
the loop, transform repeated array accesses to cached pointer arithmetics
and so on. The code is much more readable this way and gcc is fairly
good at doing optimisation. Feel free to hand-optimise it.

So, the driver works the following way:

When it has to render a page, first it sets up the basics such as margins
and papersize and alike.

Line scheduling
---------------

Then it calls the line scheduler. To see why do we have a scheduler, you
have to understand weaving. The printer head has 32 nozzles which are
spaced at 8 line intervals. Therefore, it prints 32 lines at a time but they
are distributed over a 256 line high area. Obviously, if you want to print
all the lines under the head, you should pass over the paper 8 times.
You can do it the obvious way:
Print, move down by one line, print ... repeat 8 times then move down
by 256 - 8 lines and start again. Unfortunately, this would result in
stripy images due to the differences between individual nozzles.
Lines 0-7 would be printed by nozzle 0, 8-15 by nozzle 1 and so on. An
8 line band has a visible height, so difference between nozzles will
cause 8-line high bands to appear on the image.

The solution is 'microweave', a funny way of doing interlaced printing.
Instead of moving down 1, 1, 1, 1, .. 1, 248, 1, 1 .. you move down
a constant, larger amount (called a band). This amount must be chosen
in such a way that each line will be printed and preferably it will be
printed only once.

Let for example the move down amount (the band) be 31. Let's say,
in band N nozzle 31 is over line 300, in which case nozzle 30 is over
line 292. We move the head down by 31 lines, then line 299 will be
under nozzle 27 and line 307 under nozzle 28.
Next move, nozzle 23 will print line 298 and nozzle 24 line 306, then
19/297 20/305, 15/296 16/304, 11/295 12/303, 7/294 8/302, 3/293 4/302,
0/292 3/301 which covers the entire area between 292 and 307.
The same will apply to any other area on the page. Also note that
adjacent lines are always printed by different nozzles.
You probably have realised that line 292 was printed in the first pass
and in the last one. In this case, of course, the line must not be printed
twice, one or the other pass should not deliver data to the nozzle which
passes over this line.

Now there's a twist. When the horizontal resolution is 1440 dpi you have
to print each line twice, first depositing all even pixels then offset
the head by 1/1440" and deposit all odd pixels (the printer can only
print with 720 dpi but you can initially position the head with 1440 dpi
resolution). You could do it the easy way, passing over the same area
twice but you can do better. You can find a band size which will result
each line being printed twice. Instead of suppressing the double print,
you use this mechanism to print the odd and the even pixels.
Now if you print one line's odd pixels, obviously, all lines belonging
to the 31 other nozzles of the head will have their odd pixels printed too.
Therefore, you have to keep track which lines have been printed in which
phase and try to find an odd-even phase assignment to bands so that each line
has both groups printed (and each group only once).
The added bonus is that even the same line will be printed by two different
nozzles thus effects of nozzle differences can be decreased further.

The whole issue is further complicated with the beginning of the page and
the end of the page. When you print the first 8 lines you *must* use the
print, down by 1, print ... method but then you have to switch over to the
banding method. To do it well, you should minimise the number of lines which
are printed out of band. This optimisation is not complex but not trivial
either. Our solution is to employ precalculated tables for the first 8 lines.
(Epson's solution is not to print the 'problematic' lines at all - they
warn you in the manual that at the top and bottom you may have "slight
distortions". Analyzing their output reveals the reason ... ).
The bottom is different. It is easier, because you are already banding, so
you can't screw up the rest of the image. On the other hand, you can't use
tables because these tables would depend on the page height which you don't
know a priori. Our solution is to switch to single line mode when we can
not do the banding any more and try to finish the page with the minimal
amount of passes.

So, first the driver calls the scheduler which returns a list of lines which
it dispatched to print in the current band. Then the driver checks if it has
all these lines halftoned. Since the head covers an area of 256 lines, we
have to buffer that many lines (actually, 256-7). As the head moves down,
we can flush lines which it has left and halftone the new ones.

Colour transformations
----------------------

The next important issue is the colour transformation. The reason for doing
this is that the ink is not perfect. Ideally, you have 3 inks, namely cyan
magenta and yellow. Mixing these you can have all colours. Now the inks
are not pure, that is the cyan ink contains some particles that have a
colour other than the ideal cyan and so on. In addition, the inks are
not exactly cyan, magenta and yellow. Therefore, you have to do some
transformations that will map the ideal C, M, Y values to amounts of
ink of the real kind. You also have a black ink. Although in theory
mixing C, M, Y in equal amount will give you black, it doesn't exactly
work that way. In addition, black ink is cheap compared to the colour
so if you can use black, you rather use that. On top of all that,
because of other effects (ink splashing on the paper and things like that)
you have to apply some non-linear functions to get reasonable colours.

Halftoning
----------

The driver has different halftoning methods.
There is the classic Floyd-Stenberg error diffusion. There is an other
ED, of which I'm hammering the matrix. The matrix is larger than the
FS one and IMHO results in somewhat lower halftoning noise. However,
it completely screws up some flat colours so don't use it.
There is also dithering, which is quick but noisy.

For any halftoning method, it is assumed that the haltoning can be
done on the 4 colours (CMYK) separately and all interdependencies are
already handled. It is an optimistic assumption, however, close enough.

You can add any halftoning method you like by writing a halftoner
module. A halftoner module consists of 4 functions:

- Init, which is called before halftoning starts.
- Threshold, which should return a number which tells the driver how many
  empty lines needed before halftoning can be stopped (i.e. for how many
  lines will a line affect halftoning of subsequent lines).
- Halftone, which halftones one colour of one line
- EndOfLine which is called when all colours of a scanline are halftoned,
  you can do your housekeeping functions here.

For example, in the case of ED init() clears the error buffers, threshold()
returns ~5 (5 empty lines are enough for the accumulated error to go to
almost zero), endofline() shuffles the error buffers and halftone() itself
does the error diffusion. In case of dithering, threshold is 0 (dithering
has no memory), init and endofline do nothing and halftone simply
dithers a line.

A few options are available for all halftoners:

- the black is rendered first. Now this black line is presented to all
  further passes. If a pixel is painted black, there's no point to
  deposit any other colour on it, even if the halftoning itself would do.
  Therefore, an already set black pixel can block the halftoning of colours
  for that pixel. Whether this thing is activated or not is a command line
  switch (default is on). Your halftoner may choose to ignore this flag.

- the intensity value of the light-cyan and light-magenta ink can be
  set from the command line. My experience is that the default 127 is
  good enough, but you can override it if you want to.

Apart from these features, each halftoner can have all sorts of other
switches. Currently there are switches for the Bendor ED, see the
comments in front of the BendorLine() function to see what they are.

Postprocessing
--------------

After lines are halftoned, they are packed into bitstreams. If you use
1440x720 then the 2 passes for the horizontal interleave are separated.
Postprocessing should also do the shingling/depletion, but it is not
yet done.

Compression
-----------

The driver, before it sends the data to the printer, compresses it using
RLE (run-length encoding) compression. It is not very effective but still
more than nothing. I have not yet ventured into using TIFF as output format,
it may come later.

This file is a library for parsing options in your shell scripts along
with assorted other useful supporting features that you can make use
of too.

For the simplest scripts you might need only:

  #!/bin/sh
  . relative/path/to/funclib.sh
  . relative/path/to/options-parser
  scriptversion=1.0
  func_options ${1+"$@"}
  eval set dummy "$func_options_result"; shift
  ...rest of your script...

In order for the '--version' option to work, you will need to have a
suitably formatted comment like the one at the top of this file
starting with '# Written by ' and ending with '# Copyright'.

For '-h' and '--help' to work, you will also need a one line
description of your script's purpose in a comment directly above the
'# Written by ' line, like the one at the top of this file.

The default options also support '--debug', which will turn on shell
execution tracing (see the comment above debug_cmd below for another
use), and '--verbose' and the func_verbose function to allow your script
to display verbose messages only when your user has specified
'--verbose'.

After sourcing this file, you can plug in processing for additional
options by amending the variables from the 'Configuration' section
below, and following the instructions in the 'Option parsing'
section further down.

func_version
------------
Echo version message to standard output and exit.
The version message is extracted from the calling file's header
comments, with leading '# ' stripped:
  1. First display the progname and version
  2. Followed by the header comment line matching  /^# Written by /
  3. Then a blank line followed by the first following line matching
     /^# Copyright /
  4. Immediately followed by any lines between the previous matches,
     except lines preceding the intervening completely blank line.
For example, see the header comments of this file.

Define `TT_CONFIG_OPTION_SFNT_NAMES` if your applications need to access
the internal name table in a SFNT-based format like TrueType or
OpenType.  The name table contains various strings used to describe the
font, like family name, copyright, version, etc.  It does not contain
any glyph name though.

Accessing SFNT names is done through the functions declared in
`ftsnames.h`.

@enum:
  FT_FSTYPE_XXX

@description:
  A list of bit flags used in the `fsType` field of the OS/2 table in a
  TrueType or OpenType font and the `FSType` entry in a PostScript font.
  These bit flags are returned by @FT_Get_FSType_Flags; they inform
  client applications of embedding and subsetting restrictions
  associated with a font.

  See
  https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/FontPolicies.pdf
  for more details.

@values:
  FT_FSTYPE_INSTALLABLE_EMBEDDING ::
    Fonts with no fsType bit set may be embedded and permanently
    installed on the remote system by an application.

  FT_FSTYPE_RESTRICTED_LICENSE_EMBEDDING ::
    Fonts that have only this bit set must not be modified, embedded or
    exchanged in any manner without first obtaining permission of the
    font software copyright owner.

  FT_FSTYPE_PREVIEW_AND_PRINT_EMBEDDING ::
    The font may be embedded and temporarily loaded on the remote
    system.  Documents containing Preview & Print fonts must be opened
    'read-only'; no edits can be applied to the document.

  FT_FSTYPE_EDITABLE_EMBEDDING ::
    The font may be embedded but must only be installed temporarily on
    other systems.  In contrast to Preview & Print fonts, documents
    containing editable fonts may be opened for reading, editing is
    permitted, and changes may be saved.

  FT_FSTYPE_NO_SUBSETTING ::
    The font may not be subsetted prior to embedding.

  FT_FSTYPE_BITMAP_EMBEDDING_ONLY ::
    Only bitmaps contained in the font may be embedded; no outline data
    may be embedded.  If there are no bitmaps available in the font,
    then the font is unembeddable.

@note:
  The flags are ORed together, thus more than a single value can be

  While the `fsType` flags can indicate that a font may be embedded, a
  license with the font vendor may be separately required to use the
  font in this way.

(This is a heavily cut-down "BSD license".)

This differs from Colin Plumb's older public domain implementation in that
no exactly 32-bit integer data type is required (any 32-bit or wider
unsigned integer data type will do), there's no compile-time endianness
configuration, and the function prototypes match OpenSSL's.  No code from
Colin Plumb's implementation has been reused; this comment merely compares
the properties of the two independent implementations.

The primary goals of this implementation are portability and ease of use.
It is meant to be fast, but not as fast as possible.  Some known
optimizations are not included to reduce source code size and avoid
compile-time configuration.

PostScript names are given in brackets if they differ from the
family name.  The version numbers, together with the copyright or
release year data, are taken from fonts available to the
developers.
Note that later versions of the fonts might be no longer tricky;
for example, `MingLiU' version 7.00 (file `mingliu.ttc' from
Windows 7) is an ordinary TTC with non-tricky subfonts.

 For conditions of distribution and use, see the accompanying README file.

 This file contains a command-line user interface for the JPEG compressor.
 It should work on any system with Unix- or MS-DOS-style command lines.

 Two different command line styles are permitted, depending on the
 compile-time switch TWO_FILE_COMMANDLINE:
	cjpeg [options]  inputfile outputfile
	cjpeg [options]  [inputfile]
 In the second style, output is always to standard output, which you'd
 normally redirect to a file or pipe to some other program.  Input is
 either from a named file or from standard input (typically redirected).
 The second style is convenient on Unix but is unhelpful on systems that
 don't support pipes.  Also, you MUST use the first style if your system
 doesn't do binary I/O to stdin/stdout.
 To simplify script writing, the "-outfile" switch is provided.  The syntax
	cjpeg [options]  -outfile outputfile  inputfile
 works regardless of which command line style is used.

This file contains application interface code for the compression half
of the JPEG library.  These are the "minimum" API routines that may be
needed in either the normal full-compression case or the transcoding-only
case.

Most of the routines intended to be called directly by an application
are in this file or in jcapistd.c.  But also see jcparam.c for
parameter-setup helper routines, jcomapi.c for routines shared by
compression and decompression, and jctrans.c for the transcoding case.

This file contains application interface code for the compression half
of the JPEG library.  These are the "standard" API routines that are
used in the normal full-compression case.  They are not used by a
transcoding-only application.  Note that if an application links in
jpeg_start_compress, it will end up linking in the entire compressor.
We thus must separate this file from jcapimin.c to avoid linking the
whole compression library into a transcoder.

Both sequential and progressive modes are supported in this single module.

Much of the complexity here has to do with supporting output suspension.
If the data destination module demands suspension, we want to be able to
back up to the start of the current MCU.  To do this, we copy state
variables into local working storage, and update them back to the
permanent JPEG objects only upon successful completion of an MCU.

We do not support output suspension for the progressive JPEG mode, since
the library currently does not allow multiple-scan files to be written
with output suspension.

This file contains downsampling routines.

Downsampling input data is counted in "row groups".  A row group
is defined to be max_v_samp_factor pixel rows of each component,
from which the downsampler produces v_samp_factor sample rows.
A single row group is processed in each call to the downsampler module.

The downsampler is responsible for edge-expansion of its output data
to fill an integral number of DCT blocks horizontally.  The source buffer
may be modified if it is helpful for this purpose (the source buffer is
allocated wide enough to correspond to the desired output width).
The caller (the prep controller) is responsible for vertical padding.

The downsampler may request "context rows" by setting need_context_rows
during startup.  In this case, the input arrays will contain at least
one row group's worth of pixels above and below the passed-in data;
the caller will create dummy rows at image top and bottom by replicating
the first or last real pixel row.

An excellent reference for image resampling is
  Digital Image Warping, George Wolberg, 1990.
  Pub. by IEEE Computer Society Press, Los Alamitos, CA. ISBN 0-8186-8944-7.

The downsampling algorithm used here is a simple average of the source
pixels covered by the output pixel.  The hi-falutin sampling literature
refers to this as a "box filter".  In general the characteristics of a box
filter are not very good, but for the specific cases we normally use (1:1
and 2:1 ratios) the box is equivalent to a "triangle filter" which is not
nearly so bad.  If you intend to use other sampling ratios, you'd be well
advised to improve this code.

A simple input-smoothing capability is provided.  This is mainly intended
for cleaning up color-dithered GIF input files (if you find it inadequate,
we suggest using an external filtering program such as pnmconvol).  When
enabled, each input pixel P is replaced by a weighted sum of itself and its
eight neighbors.  P's weight is 1-8*SF and each neighbor's weight is SF,
where SF = (smoothing_factor / 1024).
Currently, smoothing is only supported for 2h2v sampling factors.

 This file contains code for merged upsampling/color conversion.

 This file combines functions from jdsample.c and jdcolor.c;
 read those files first to understand what's going on.

 When the chroma components are to be upsampled by simple replication
 (ie, box filtering), we can save some work in color conversion by
 calculating all the output pixels corresponding to a pair of chroma
 samples at one time.  In the conversion equations
	R = Y           + K1 * Cr
	G = Y + K2 * Cb + K3 * Cr
	B = Y + K4 * Cb
 only the Y term varies among the group of pixels corresponding to a pair
 of chroma samples, so the rest of the terms can be calculated just once.
 At typical sampling ratios, this eliminates half or three-quarters of the
 multiplications needed for color conversion.

 This file currently provides implementations for the following cases:
	YCC => RGB color conversion only (YCbCr or BG_YCC).
	Sampling ratios of 2h1v or 2h2v.
	No scaling needed at upsample time.
	Corner-aligned (non-CCIR601) sampling alignment.
 Other special cases could be added, but in most applications these are
 the only common cases.  (For uncommon cases we fall back on the more
 general code in jdsample.c and jdcolor.c.)

This file contains a floating-point implementation of the
forward DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform).

This implementation should be more accurate than either of the integer
DCT implementations.  However, it may not give the same results on all
machines because of differences in roundoff behavior.  Speed will depend
on the hardware's floating point capacity.

A 2-D DCT can be done by 1-D DCT on each row followed by 1-D DCT
on each column.  Direct algorithms are also available, but they are
much more complex and seem not to be any faster when reduced to code.

This implementation is based on Arai, Agui, and Nakajima's algorithm for
scaled DCT.  Their original paper (Trans. IEICE E-71(11):1095) is in
Japanese, but the algorithm is described in the Pennebaker & Mitchell
JPEG textbook (see REFERENCES section in file README).  The following code
is based directly on figure 4-8 in P&M.
While an 8-point DCT cannot be done in less than 11 multiplies, it is
possible to arrange the computation so that many of the multiplies are
simple scalings of the final outputs.  These multiplies can then be
folded into the multiplications or divisions by the JPEG quantization
table entries.  The AA&N method leaves only 5 multiplies and 29 adds
to be done in the DCT itself.
The primary disadvantage of this method is that with a fixed-point
implementation, accuracy is lost due to imprecise representation of the
scaled quantization values.  However, that problem does not arise if
we use floating point arithmetic.

This file contains a slow-but-accurate integer implementation of the
forward DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform).

A 2-D DCT can be done by 1-D DCT on each row followed by 1-D DCT
on each column.  Direct algorithms are also available, but they are
much more complex and seem not to be any faster when reduced to code.

This implementation is based on an algorithm described in
  C. Loeffler, A. Ligtenberg and G. Moschytz, "Practical Fast 1-D DCT
  Algorithms with 11 Multiplications", Proc. Int'l. Conf. on Acoustics,
  Speech, and Signal Processing 1989 (ICASSP '89), pp. 988-991.
The primary algorithm described there uses 11 multiplies and 29 adds.
We use their alternate method with 12 multiplies and 32 adds.
The advantage of this method is that no data path contains more than one
multiplication; this allows a very simple and accurate implementation in
scaled fixed-point arithmetic, with a minimal number of shifts.

We also provide FDCT routines with various input sample block sizes for
direct resolution reduction or enlargement and for direct resolving the
common 2x1 and 1x2 subsampling cases without additional resampling: NxN
(N=1...16), 2NxN, and Nx2N (N=1...8) pixels for one 8x8 output DCT block.

For N<8 we fill the remaining block coefficients with zero.
For N>8 we apply a partial N-point FDCT on the input samples, computing
just the lower 8 frequency coefficients and discarding the rest.

We must scale the output coefficients of the N-point FDCT appropriately
to the standard 8-point FDCT level by 8/N per 1-D pass.  This scaling
is folded into the constant multipliers (pass 2) and/or final/initial
shifting.

CAUTION: We rely on the FIX() macro except for the N=1,2,4,8 cases
since there would be too many additional constants to pre-calculate.

This implementation is based on Arai, Agui, and Nakajima's algorithm for
scaled DCT.  Their original paper (Trans. IEICE E-71(11):1095) is in
Japanese, but the algorithm is described in the Pennebaker & Mitchell
JPEG textbook (see REFERENCES section in file README).  The following code
is based directly on figure 4-8 in P&M.
While an 8-point DCT cannot be done in less than 11 multiplies, it is
possible to arrange the computation so that many of the multiplies are
simple scalings of the final outputs.  These multiplies can then be
folded into the multiplications or divisions by the JPEG quantization
table entries.  The AA&N method leaves only 5 multiplies and 29 adds
to be done in the DCT itself.
The primary disadvantage of this method is that with fixed-point math,
accuracy is lost due to imprecise representation of the scaled
quantization values.  The smaller the quantization table entry, the less
precise the scaled value, so this implementation does worse with high-
quality-setting files than with low-quality ones.

jidctint.c

Copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane.
Modification developed 2002-2018 by Guido Vollbeding.
This file is part of the Independent JPEG Group's software.
For conditions of distribution and use, see the accompanying README file.

This file contains a slow-but-accurate integer implementation of the
inverse DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform).  In the IJG code, this routine
must also perform dequantization of the input coefficients.

A 2-D IDCT can be done by 1-D IDCT on each column followed by 1-D IDCT
on each row (or vice versa, but it's more convenient to emit a row at
a time).  Direct algorithms are also available, but they are much more
complex and seem not to be any faster when reduced to code.

This implementation is based on an algorithm described in
  C. Loeffler, A. Ligtenberg and G. Moschytz, "Practical Fast 1-D DCT
  Algorithms with 11 Multiplications", Proc. Int'l. Conf. on Acoustics,
  Speech, and Signal Processing 1989 (ICASSP '89), pp. 988-991.
The primary algorithm described there uses 11 multiplies and 29 adds.
We use their alternate method with 12 multiplies and 32 adds.
The advantage of this method is that no data path contains more than one
multiplication; this allows a very simple and accurate implementation in
scaled fixed-point arithmetic, with a minimal number of shifts.

We also provide IDCT routines with various output sample block sizes for
direct resolution reduction or enlargement and for direct resolving the
common 2x1 and 1x2 subsampling cases without additional resampling: NxN
(N=1...16), 2NxN, and Nx2N (N=1...8) pixels for one 8x8 input DCT block.

For N<8 we simply take the corresponding low-frequency coefficients of
the 8x8 input DCT block and apply an NxN point IDCT on the sub-block
to yield the downscaled outputs.
This can be seen as direct low-pass downsampling from the DCT domain
point of view rather than the usual spatial domain point of view,
yielding significant computational savings and results at least
as good as common bilinear (averaging) spatial downsampling.

For N>8 we apply a partial NxN IDCT on the 8 input coefficients as
lower frequencies and higher frequencies assumed to be zero.
It turns out that the computational effort is similar to the 8x8 IDCT
regarding the output size.
Furthermore, the scaling and descaling is the same for all IDCT sizes.

CAUTION: We rely on the FIX() macro except for the N=1,2,4,8 cases
since there would be too many additional constants to pre-calculate.

For conditions of distribution and use, see the accompanying README file.

jmemmac.c provides an Apple Macintosh implementation of the system-
dependent portion of the JPEG memory manager.

If you use jmemmac.c, then you must define USE_MAC_MEMMGR in the
JPEG_INTERNALS part of jconfig.h.

jmemmac.c uses the Macintosh toolbox routines NewPtr and DisposePtr
instead of malloc and free.  It accurately determines the amount of
memory available by using CompactMem.  Notice that if left to its
own devices, this code can chew up all available space in the
application's zone, with the exception of the rather small "slop"
factor computed in jpeg_mem_available().  The application can ensure
that more space is left over by reducing max_memory_to_use.

Large images are swapped to disk using temporary files and System 7.0+'s
temporary folder functionality.

Note that jmemmac.c depends on two features of MacOS that were first
introduced in System 7: FindFolder and the FSSpec-based calls.
If your application uses jmemmac.c and is run under System 6 or earlier,
and the jpeg library decides it needs a temporary file, it will abort,
printing error messages about requiring System 7.  (If no temporary files
are created, it will run fine.)

If you want to use jmemmac.c in an application that might be used with
System 6 or earlier, then you should remove dependencies on FindFolder
and the FSSpec calls.  You will need to replace FindFolder with some
other mechanism for finding a place to put temporary files, and you
should replace the FSSpec calls with their HFS equivalents:

    FSpDelete     ->  HDelete
    FSpGetFInfo   ->  HGetFInfo
    FSpCreate     ->  HCreate
    FSpOpenDF     ->  HOpen      *** Note: not HOpenDF ***
    FSMakeFSSpec  ->  (fill in spec by hand.)

(Use HOpen instead of HOpenDF.  HOpen is just a glue-interface to PBHOpen,
which is on all HFS macs.  HOpenDF is a System 7 addition which avoids the
ages-old problem of names starting with a period.)

This file is part of the Independent JPEG Group's software.
For conditions of distribution and use, see the accompanying README file.

This file contains the JPEG system-independent memory management
routines.  This code is usable across a wide variety of machines; most
of the system dependencies have been isolated in a separate file.
The major functions provided here are:
  * pool-based allocation and freeing of memory;
  * policy decisions about how to divide available memory among the
    virtual arrays;
  * control logic for swapping virtual arrays between main memory and
    backing storage.
The separate system-dependent file provides the actual backing-storage
access code, and it contains the policy decision about how much total
main memory to use.
This file is system-dependent in the sense that some of its functions
are unnecessary in some systems.  For example, if there is enough virtual
memory so that backing storage will never be used, much of the virtual
array control logic could be removed.  (Of course, if you have that much
memory then you shouldn't care about a little bit of unused code...)

This file provides a really simple implementation of the system-

assumes that no backing-store files are needed: all required space
can be obtained from malloc().
This is very portable in the sense that it'll compile on almost anything,
but you'd better have lots of main memory (or virtual memory) if you want
to process big images.
Note that the max_memory_to_use option is respected by this implementation.

This file contains routines to read input images in Microsoft "BMP"
format (MS Windows 3.x, OS/2 1.x, and OS/2 2.x flavors).
Currently, only 8-, 24-, and 32-bit images are supported, not 1-bit or
4-bit (feeding such low-depth images into JPEG would be silly anyway).
Also, we don't support RLE-compressed files.

These routines may need modification for non-Unix environments or
specialized applications.  As they stand, they assume input from
an ordinary stdio stream.  They further assume that reading begins
at the start of the file; start_input may need work if the
user interface has already read some data (e.g., to determine that
the file is indeed BMP format).

This file implements djpeg's "-map file" switch.  It reads a source image
and constructs a colormap to be supplied to the JPEG decompressor.

Currently, these file formats are supported for the map file:
  GIF: the contents of the GIF's global colormap are used.
  PPM (either text or raw flavor): the entire file is read and
     each unique pixel value is entered in the map.
Note that reading a large PPM file will be horrendously slow.
Typically, a PPM-format map file should contain just one pixel
of each desired color.  Such a file can be extracted from an
ordinary image PPM file with ppmtomap(1).

Rescaling a PPM that has a maxval unequal to MAXJSAMPLE is not
currently implemented.

Documentation:
   http://www.kandroid.org/ndk/docs/CPU-ARM-NEON.html
   https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=49065

NOTE: this requires that libpng is built against the Android NDK and linked
with an implementation of the Android ARM 'cpu-features' library.  The code
has been compiled only, not linked: no version of the library has been found,
only the header files exist in the NDK.

STATUS: COMPILED, TESTED
BUG REPORTS: png-mng-implement@sourceforge.net

png_have_neon implemented for Linux versions which allow access to
/proc/self/auxv.  This is probably faster, cleaner and safer than the code to
read /proc/cpuinfo in contrib/arm-neon/linux, however it is yet another piece
of potentially untested code and has more complex dependencies than the code
to read cpuinfo.

This generic __linux__ implementation requires reading /proc/self/auxv and
looking at each element for one that records NEON capabilities.

STATUS: SUPPORTED
BUG REPORTS: png-mng-implement@sourceforge.net

png_have_neon implemented for Linux by reading the widely available
pseudo-file /proc/cpuinfo.

This code is strict ANSI-C and is probably moderately portable; it does
however use <stdio.h> and it assumes that /proc/cpuinfo is never localized.

 Extract any icc profiles found in the given PNG files.  This is a simple
 example of a program that extracts information from the header of a PNG file
 without processing the image.  Notice that some header information may occur
 after the image data. Textual data and comments are an example; the approach
 in this file won't work reliably for such data because it only looks for the
 information in the section of the file that precedes the image data.

 Compile and link against libpng and zlib, plus anything else required on the
 system you use.

 To use supply a list of PNG files containing iCCP chunks, the chunks will be
 extracted to a similarly named file with the extension replaced by 'icc',
 which will be overwritten without warning.

 Read a single pixel value from a PNG file.

 This code illustrates basic 'by-row' reading of a PNG file using libpng.
 Rows are read until a particular pixel is found; the value of this pixel is
 then printed on stdout.

 The code illustrates how to do this on interlaced as well as non-interlaced
 images.  Normally you would call png_set_interlace_handling() to have libpng
 deal with the interlace for you, but that obliges you to buffer half of the
 image to assemble the interlaced rows.  In this code
 png_set_interlace_handling() is not called and, instead, the code handles the
 interlace passes directly looking for the required pixel.

 Read a PNG and write it out in a fixed format, using the 'simplified API'
 that was introduced in libpng-1.6.0.

 This sample code is just the code from the top of 'example.c' with some error
 handling added.  See example.c for more comments.

libpng/contrib/examples/simpleover.c

- simpleover

 COPYRIGHT: Written by John Cunningham Bowler, 2015.
 To the extent possible under law, the author has waived all copyright and
 related or neighboring rights to this work.  This work is published from:
 United States.

 Read several PNG files, which should have an alpha channel or transparency
 information, and composite them together to produce one or more 16-bit linear
 RGBA intermediates.  This involves doing the correct 'over' composition to
 combine the alpha channels and corresponding data.

 Finally read an output (background) PNG using the 24-bit RGB format (the
 PNG will be composited on green (#00ff00) by default if it has an alpha
 channel), and apply the intermediate image generated above to specified
 locations in the image.

 The command line has the general format:

    simpleover <background.png> [output.png]
        {--sprite=width,height,name {[--at=x,y] {sprite.png}}}
        {--add=name {x,y}}

 The --sprite and --add options may occur multiple times. They are executed
 in order.  --add may refer to any sprite already read.

 This code is intended to show how to composite multiple images together
 correctly.  Apart from the libpng Simplified API the only work done in here
 is to combine multiple input PNG images into a single sprite; this involves
 a Porter-Duff 'over' operation and the input PNG images may, as a result,
 be regarded as being layered one on top of the other with the first (leftmost
 on the command line) being at the bottom and the last on the top.

libpng/contrib/gregbook/rpng-win.c

 rpng - simple PNG display program                             rpng-win.c

 This program decodes and displays PNG images, with gamma correction and
 optionally with a user-specified background color (in case the image has
 transparency).  It is very nearly the most basic PNG viewer possible.
 This version is for 32-bit Windows; it may compile under 16-bit Windows
 with a little tweaking (or maybe not).

 to do:
  - handle quoted command-line args (especially filenames with spaces)
  - have minimum window width:  oh well
  - use %.1023s to simplify truncation of title-bar string?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Changelog:
  - 1.00:  initial public release
  - 1.01:  modified to allow abbreviated options; fixed long/ulong mis-
            match; switched to png_jmpbuf() macro
  - 1.02:  added extra set of parentheses to png_jmpbuf() macro; fixed
            command-line parsing bug
  - 1.10:  enabled "message window"/console (thanks to David Geldreich)
  - 2.00:  dual-licensed (added GNU GPL)
  - 2.01:  fixed improper display of usage screen on PNG error(s)
  - 2.02:  check for integer overflow (Glenn R-P)

 rpng - simple PNG display program                               rpng-x.c

 This program decodes and displays PNG images, with gamma correction and
 optionally with a user-specified background color (in case the image has
 transparency).  It is very nearly the most basic PNG viewer possible.
 This version is for the X Window System (tested by author under Unix and
 by Martin Zinser under OpenVMS; may work under OS/2 with some tweaking).

 to do:
  - 8-bit (colormapped) X support
  - use %.1023s to simplify truncation of title-bar string?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Changelog:
  - 1.01:  initial public release
  - 1.02:  modified to allow abbreviated options; fixed long/ulong mis-
            match; switched to png_jmpbuf() macro
  - 1.10:  added support for non-default visuals; fixed X pixel-conversion
  - 1.11:  added extra set of parentheses to png_jmpbuf() macro; fixed
            command-line parsing bug
  - 1.12:  fixed some small X memory leaks (thanks to Fran�ois Petitjean)
  - 1.13:  fixed XFreeGC() crash bug (thanks to Patrick Welche)
  - 1.14:  added support for X resources (thanks to Gerhard Niklasch)
  - 2.00:  dual-licensed (added GNU GPL)
  - 2.01:  fixed improper display of usage screen on PNG error(s)
  - 2.02:  Added "void(argc);" statement to quiet pedantic compiler warnings
           about unused variable (GR-P)
  - 2.03:  check for integer overflow (Glenn R-P)

 rpng2 - progressive-model PNG display program                rpng2-win.c

 This program decodes and displays PNG files progressively, as if it were
 a web browser (though the front end is only set up to read from files).
 It supports gamma correction, user-specified background colors, and user-
 specified background patterns (for transparent images).  This version is
 for 32-bit Windows; it may compile under 16-bit Windows with a little
 tweaking (or maybe not).  Thanks to Adam Costello and Pieter S. van der
 Meulen for the "diamond" and "radial waves" patterns, respectively.

 to do (someday, maybe):
  - handle quoted command-line args (especially filenames with spaces)
  - finish resizable checkerboard-gradient (sizes 4-128?)
  - use %.1023s to simplify truncation of title-bar string?
  - have minimum window width:  oh well

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Changelog:
  - 1.01:  initial public release
  - 1.02:  fixed cut-and-paste error in usage screen (oops...)
  - 1.03:  modified to allow abbreviated options
  - 1.04:  removed bogus extra argument from usage fprintf() [Glenn R-P?];
            fixed command-line parsing bug
  - 1.10:  enabled "message window"/console (thanks to David Geldreich)
  - 1.20:  added runtime MMX-enabling/disabling and new -mmx* options
  - 1.21:  made minor tweak to usage screen to fit within 25-line console
  - 1.22:  added AMD64/EM64T support (__x86_64__)
  - 2.00:  dual-licensed (added GNU GPL)
  - 2.01:  fixed 64-bit typo in readpng2.c
  - 2.02:  fixed improper display of usage screen on PNG error(s); fixed
            unexpected-EOF and file-read-error cases
  - 2.03:  removed runtime MMX-enabling/disabling and obsolete -mmx* options
  - 2.04:  check for integer overflow (Glenn R-P)

 wpng - simple PNG-writing program                                 wpng.c

 This program converts certain NetPBM binary files (grayscale and RGB,
 maxval = 255) to PNG.  Non-interlaced PNGs are written progressively;
 interlaced PNGs are read and written in one memory-intensive blast.

 Thanks to Jean-loup Gailly for providing the necessary trick to read
 interactive text from the keyboard while stdin is redirected.  Thanks
 to Cosmin Truta for Cygwin fixes.

 NOTE:  includes provisional support for PNM type "8" (portable alphamap)
        images, presumed to be a 32-bit interleaved RGBA format; no pro-
        vision for possible interleaved grayscale+alpha (16-bit) format.
        THIS IS UNLIKELY TO BECOME AN OFFICIAL NETPBM ALPHA FORMAT!

 to do:
  - delete output file if quit before calling any writepng routines
  - process backspace with -text option under DOS/Win? (currently get ^H)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Changelog:
  - 1.01:  initial public release
  - 1.02:  modified to allow abbreviated options
  - 1.03:  removed extraneous character from usage screen; fixed bug in
            command-line parsing
  - 1.04:  fixed DOS/OS2/Win32 detection, including partial Cygwin fix
            (see http://home.att.net/~perlspinr/diffs/GregBook_cygwin.diff)
  - 2.00:  dual-licensed (added GNU GPL)
  - 2.01:  check for integer overflow (Glenn R-P)

      [REPORTED BUG (win32 only):  "contrib/gregbook/wpng.c - cmd line
       dose not work!  In order to do something useful I needed to redirect
       both input and output, with cygwin and with bcc32 as well.  Under
       Linux, the same wpng appears to work fine.  I don't know what is
       the problem."]

Generate a set of PNG test images.  The images are generated in a
sub-directory called 'tests' by default, however a command line argument will
change that name.  The generation requires a built version of makepng in the
current directory.

Make a test PNG image.  The arguments are as follows:

   makepng [--sRGB|--linear|--1.8] [--tRNS] [--nofilters] \
      color-type bit-depth [file-name]

The color-type may be numeric (and must match the numbers used by the PNG
specification) or one of the format names listed below.  The bit-depth is the
component bit depth, or the pixel bit-depth for a color-mapped image.

Without any options no color-space information is written, with the options
an sRGB or the appropriate gAMA chunk is written.  "1.8" refers to the
display system used on older Apple computers to correct for high ambient
light levels in the viewing environment; it applies a transform of
approximately value^(1/1.45) to the color values and so a gAMA chunk of 65909
is written (1.45/2.2).

The image data is generated internally.  Unless --color is given the images
used are as follows:

1 channel: a square image with a diamond, the least luminous colors are on
   the edge of the image, the most luminous in the center.

2 channels: the color channel increases in luminosity from top to bottom, the
   alpha channel increases in opacity from left to right.

3 channels: linear combinations of, from the top-left corner clockwise,
   black, green, white, red.

4 channels: linear combinations of, from the top-left corner clockwise,
   transparent, red, green, blue.

For color-mapped images a four channel color-map is used and if --tRNS is
given the PNG file has a tRNS chunk, as follows:

1-bit: entry 0 is transparent-red, entry 1 is opaque-white
2-bit: entry 0: transparent-green
       entry 1: 40%-red
       entry 2: 80%-blue
       entry 3: opaque-white
4-bit: the 16 combinations of the 2-bit case
8-bit: the 256 combinations of the 4-bit case

The palette always has 2^bit-depth entries and the tRNS chunk one fewer.  The
image is the 1-channel diamond, but using palette index, not luminosity.

For formats other than color-mapped ones if --tRNS is specified a tRNS chunk
is generated with all channels equal to the low bits of 0x0101.

Image size is determined by the final pixel depth in bits, i.e. channels x
bit-depth, as follows:

8 bits or less:    64x64
16 bits:           256x256
More than 16 bits: 1024x1024

Row filtering is the libpng default but may be turned off (the 'none' filter
is used on every row) with the --nofilters option.

The images are not interlaced.

If file-name is given then the PNG is written to that file, else it is
written to stdout.  Notice that stdout is not supported on systems where, by
default, it assumes text output; this program makes no attempt to change the
text mode of stdout!

   makepng --color=<color> ...

If --color is given then the whole image has that color, color-mapped images
will have exactly one palette entry and all image files with be 16x16 in
size.  The color value is 1 to 4 decimal numbers as appropriate for the color
type.

   makepng --small ...

If --small is given the images are no larger than required to include every
possible pixel value for the format.

For formats with pixels 8 bits or fewer in size the images consist of a
single row with 2^pixel-depth pixels, one of every possible value.

For formats with 16-bit pixels a 256x256 image is generated containing every
possible pixel value.

For larger pixel sizes a 256x256 image is generated where the first row
consists of each pixel that has identical byte values throughout the pixel
followed by rows where the byte values differ within the pixel.

In all cases the pixel values are arranged in such a way that the SUB and UP
filters give byte sequences for maximal zlib compression.  By default (if
--nofilters is not given) the SUB filter is used on the first row and the UP
filter on all following rows.

The --small option is meant to provide good test-case coverage, however the
images are not easy to examine visually.  Without the --small option the
images contain identical color values; the pixel values are adjusted
according to the gamma encoding with no gamma encoding being interpreted as
sRGB.

Generate a PNG with an alpha channel, correctly.

This is a test case generator; the resultant PNG files are only of interest
to those of us who care about whether the edges of circles are green, red,
or yellow.

The program generates an RGB+Alpha PNG of a given size containing the given
shapes on a transparent background:

 genpng width height { shape }
   shape ::= color width shape x1 y1 x2 y2

'color' is:

 black white red green yellow blue brown purple pink orange gray cyan

The point is to have colors that are linguistically meaningful plus that old
bugbear of the department store dress murders, Cyan, the only color we argue
about.

'shape' is:

 circle: an ellipse
 square: a rectangle
 line: a straight line

Each shape is followed by four numbers, these are two points in the output
coordinate space (as real numbers) which describe the circle, square, or
line.  The shape is filled if it is preceded by 'filled' (not valid for
'line') or is drawn with a line, in which case the width of the line must
precede the shape.

The whole set of information can be repeated as many times as desired:

   shape ::= color width shape x1 y1 x2 y2

   color ::= black|white|red|green|yellow|blue
   color ::= brown|purple|pink|orange|gray|cyan
   width ::= filled
   width ::= <number>
   shape ::= circle|square|line
   x1    ::= <number>
   x2    ::= <number>
   y1    ::= <number>
   y2    ::= <number>

The output PNG is generated by down-sampling a 4x supersampled image using
a bi-cubic filter.  The bi-cubic has a 2 (output) pixel width, so an 8x8
array of super-sampled points contribute to each output pixel.  The value of
a super-sampled point is found using an unfiltered, aliased, infinite
precision image: Each shape from the last to the first is checked to see if
the point is in the drawn area and, if it is, the color of the point is the
color of the shape and the alpha is 1, if not the previous shape is checked.

This is an aliased algorithm because no filtering is done; a point is either
inside or outside each shape and 'close' points do not contribute to the
sample.  The down-sampling is relied on to correct the error of not using
a filter.

The line end-caps are 'flat'; they go through the points.  The square line
joins are mitres; the outside of the lines are continued to the point of
intersection.

Usage:

    png-fix-itxt < bad.png > good.png

Fixes a PNG file written with libpng-1.6.0 or 1.6.1 that has one or more
uncompressed iTXt chunks.  Assumes that the actual length is greater
than or equal to the value in the length byte, and that the CRC is
correct for the actual length.  This program hunts for the CRC and
adjusts the length byte accordingly.  It is not an error to process a
PNG file that has no iTXt chunks or one that has valid iTXt chunks;
such files will simply be copied.

Requires zlib (for crc32 and Z_NULL); build with

    gcc -O -o png-fix-itxt png-fix-itxt.c -lz

If you need to handle iTXt chunks larger than 500000 kbytes you must
rebuild png-fix-itxt with a larger values of MAX_LENGTH (or a smaller value
if you know you will never encounter such huge iTXt chunks).

to manipulate the compression of the PNG data and other compressed chunks.

For a more extensive example that uses the transforms see
contrib/libtests/pngimage.c in the libpng distribution.

This code is not intended for installation in a release system; the command
line options are not documented and most of the behavior is intended for
testing libpng performance, both speed and compression.

cexcept.h 2.0.1 (2008-Jul-19-Sat)
http://www.nicemice.net/cexcept/
Adam M. Costello
http://www.nicemice.net/amc/

An interface for exception-handling in ANSI C (C89 and subsequent ISO
standards), developed jointly with Cosmin Truta.

    Copyright (c) 2000-2008 Adam M. Costello and Cosmin Truta.
    This software may be modified only if its author and version
    information is updated accurately, and may be redistributed
    only if accompanied by this unaltered notice.  Subject to those
    restrictions, permission is granted to anyone to do anything
    with this software.  The copyright holders make no guarantees
    regarding this software, and are not responsible for any damage
    resulting from its use.

The cexcept interface is not compatible with and cannot interact
with system exceptions (like division by zero or memory segmentation
violation), compiler-generated exceptions (like C++ exceptions), or
other exception-handling interfaces.

When using this interface across multiple .c files, do not include
this header file directly.  Instead, create a wrapper header file that
includes this header file and then invokes the define_exception_type
macro (see below).  The .c files should then include that header file.

The interface consists of one type, one well-known name, and six macros.


define_exception_type(type_name);

    This macro is used like an external declaration.  It specifies
    the type of object that gets copied from the exception thrower to
    the exception catcher.  The type_name can be any type that can be
    assigned to, that is, a non-constant arithmetic type, struct, union,
    or pointer.  Examples:

        define_exception_type(int);

        enum exception { out_of_memory, bad_arguments, disk_full };
        define_exception_type(enum exception);

        struct exception { int code; const char *msg; };
        define_exception_type(struct exception);

    Because throwing an exception causes the object to be copied (not
    just once, but twice), programmers may wish to consider size when
    choosing the exception type.


struct exception_context;

    This type may be used after the define_exception_type() macro has
    been invoked.  A struct exception_context must be known to both
    the thrower and the catcher.  It is expected that there be one
    context for each thread that uses exceptions.  It would certainly
    be dangerous for multiple threads to access the same context.
    One thread can use multiple contexts, but that is likely to be
    confusing and not typically useful.  The application can allocate
    this structure in any way it pleases--automatic, static, or dynamic.
    The application programmer should pretend not to know the structure
    members, which are subject to change.


struct exception_context *the_exception_context;

    The Try/Catch and Throw statements (described below) implicitly
    refer to a context, using the name the_exception_context.  It is
    the application's responsibility to make sure that this name yields
    the address of a mutable (non-constant) struct exception_context
    wherever those statements are used.  Subject to that constraint, the
    application may declare a variable of this name anywhere it likes
    (inside a function, in a parameter list, or externally), and may
    use whatever storage class specifiers (static, extern, etc) or type
    qualifiers (const, volatile, etc) it likes.  Examples:

        static struct exception_context
          * const the_exception_context = &foo;

        { struct exception_context *the_exception_context = bar; ... }

        int blah(struct exception_context *the_exception_context, ...);

        extern struct exception_context the_exception_context[1];

    The last example illustrates a trick that avoids creating a pointer
    object separate from the structure object.

    The name could even be a macro, for example:

        struct exception_context ec_array[numthreads];
        #define the_exception_context (ec_array + thread_id)

    Be aware that the_exception_context is used several times by the
    Try/Catch/Throw macros, so it shouldn't be expensive or have side
    effects.  The expansion must be a drop-in replacement for an
    identifier, so it's safest to put parentheses around it.


void init_exception_context(struct exception_context *ec);

    For context structures allocated statically (by an external
    definition or using the "static" keyword), the implicit
    initialization to all zeros is sufficient, but contexts allocated
    by other means must be initialized using this macro before they
    are used by a Try/Catch statement.  It does no harm to initialize
    a context more than once (by using this macro on a statically
    allocated context, or using this macro twice on the same context),
    but a context must not be re-initialized after it has been used by a
    Try/Catch statement.


Try statement
Catch (expression) statement

    The Try/Catch/Throw macros are capitalized in order to avoid
    confusion with the C++ keywords, which have subtly different
    semantics.

    A Try/Catch statement has a syntax similar to an if/else statement,
    except that the parenthesized expression goes after the second
    keyword rather than the first.  As with if/else, there are two
    clauses, each of which may be a simple statement ending with a
    semicolon or a brace-enclosed compound statement.  But whereas
    the else clause is optional, the Catch clause is required.  The
    expression must be a modifiable lvalue (something capable of being
    assigned to) of the same type (disregarding type qualifiers) that
    was passed to define_exception_type().

    If a Throw that uses the same exception context as the Try/Catch is
    executed within the Try clause (typically within a function called
    by the Try clause), and the exception is not caught by a nested
    Try/Catch statement, then a copy of the exception will be assigned
    to the expression, and control will jump to the Catch clause.  If no
    such Throw is executed, then the assignment is not performed, and
    the Catch clause is not executed.

    The expression is not evaluated unless and until the exception is
    caught, which is significant if it has side effects, for example:

        Try foo();
        Catch (p[++i].e) { ... }

    IMPORTANT: Jumping into or out of a Try clause (for example via
    return, break, continue, goto, longjmp) is forbidden--the compiler
    will not complain, but bad things will happen at run-time.  Jumping
    into or out of a Catch clause is okay, and so is jumping around
    inside a Try clause.  In many cases where one is tempted to return
    from a Try clause, it will suffice to use Throw, and then return
    from the Catch clause.  Another option is to set a flag variable and
    use goto to jump to the end of the Try clause, then check the flag
    after the Try/Catch statement.

    IMPORTANT: The values of any non-volatile automatic variables
    changed within the Try clause are undefined after an exception is
    caught.  Therefore, variables modified inside the Try block whose
    values are needed later outside the Try block must either use static
    storage or be declared with the "volatile" type qualifier.


Throw expression;

    A Throw statement is very much like a return statement, except that
    the expression is required.  Whereas return jumps back to the place
    where the current function was called, Throw jumps back to the Catch
    clause of the innermost enclosing Try clause.  The expression must
    be compatible with the type passed to define_exception_type().  The
    exception must be caught, otherwise the program may crash.

    Slight limitation:  If the expression is a comma-expression, it must
    be enclosed in parentheses.


Try statement
Catch_anonymous statement

    When the value of the exception is not needed, a Try/Catch statement
    can use Catch_anonymous instead of Catch (expression).


Everything below this point is for the benefit of the compiler.  The
application programmer should pretend not to know any of it, because it
is subject to change.

The file libpng-manual.txt is much more verbose then this.  If you have
not read it, do so first.  This was designed to be a starting point of an
implementation.  This is not officially part of libpng, is hereby placed

This file does not currently compile, because it is missing certain
parts, like allocating memory to hold an image.  You will have to
supply these parts to get it to compile.  For an example of a minimal
working PNG reader/writer, see pngtest.c, included in this distribution;

## Files:
libpng/png.h

A "png_get_copyright" function is available, for convenient use in "about"
boxes and the like:

   printf("%s", png_get_copyright(NULL));

Also, the PNG logo (in PNG format, of course) is supplied in the
files "pngbar.png" and "pngbar.jpg (88x31) and "pngnow.png" (98x31).


## Files:
libpng/png.h

With all write APIs if image is in one of the linear formats with 16-bit
data then setting convert_to_8_bit will cause the output to be an 8-bit PNG
gamma encoded according to the sRGB specification, otherwise a 16-bit linear
encoded PNG file is written.

With color-mapped data formats the colormap parameter point to a color-map
with at least image->colormap_entries encoded in the specified format.  If
the format is linear the written PNG color-map will be converted to sRGB
regardless of the convert_to_8_bit flag.

With all APIs row_stride is handled as in the read APIs - it is the spacing
from one row to the next in component sized units (1 or 2 bytes) and if
negative indicates a bottom-up row layout in the buffer.  If row_stride is
zero, libpng will calculate it for you from the image width and number of
channels.

Note that the write API does not support interlacing, sub-8-bit pixels or
most ancillary chunks.  If you need to write text chunks (e.g. for copyright
notices) you need to use one of the other APIs.

This file provides a location for all input.  Users who need
special handling are expected to write a function that has the same
arguments as this and performs a similar function, but that possibly
has a different input method.  Note that you shouldn't change this
function, but rather write a replacement function and then make
libpng use it at run time with png_set_read_fn(...).

The functions here are used during reads to store data from the file
into the info struct, and during writes to store application data
into the info struct for writing into the file.  This abstracts the
info struct and allows us to change the structure in the future.

and license in png.h

This program reads in a PNG image, writes it out again, and then
compares the two files.  If the files are identical, this shows that
the basic chunk handling, filtering, and (de)compression code is working
properly.  It does not currently test all of the transforms, although
it probably should.

The program will report "FAIL" in certain legitimate cases:
1) when the compression level or filter selection method is changed.
2) when the maximum IDAT size (PNG_ZBUF_SIZE in pngconf.h) is not 8192.
3) unknown unsafe-to-copy ancillary chunks or unknown critical chunks
   exist in the input file.
4) others not listed here...
In these cases, it is best to check with another tool such as "pngcheck"
to see what the differences between the two files are.

If a filename is given on the command-line, then this file is used
for the input, rather than the default "pngtest.png".  This allows
testing a wide variety of files easily.  You can also test a number
of files at once by typing "pngtest -m file1.png file2.png ..."

tesseract/src/ccmain/tesseractclass.cpp

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 File:        tesseractclass.cpp
 Description: The Tesseract class. It holds/owns everything needed
              to run Tesseract on a single language, and also a set of
              sub-Tesseracts to run sub-languages. For thread safety, *every*
              variable that was previously global or static (except for
              constant data, and some visual debugging flags) has been moved
              in here, directly, or indirectly.
              This makes it safe to run multiple Tesseracts in different
              threads in parallel, and keeps the different language
              instances separate.
              Some global functions remain, but they are isolated re-entrant
              functions that operate on their arguments. Functions that work
              on variable data have been moved to an appropriate class based
              mostly on the directory hierarchy. For more information see
              slide 6 of "2ArchitectureAndDataStructures" in
 https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7l10Bj_LprhbUlIUFlCdGtDYkE/edit?usp=sharing
              Some global data and related functions still exist in the
              training-related code, but they don't interfere with normal
              recognition operation.

This module may look unnecessarily verbose, but here's the philosophy...

ALL processing of the reject map is done in this module. There are lots of
separate calls to set reject/accept flags. These have DELIBERATELY been kept
distinct so that this module can decide what to do.

Basically, there is a flag for each sort of rejection or acceptance. This
provides a history of what has happened to EACH character.

Determining whether a character is CURRENTLY rejected depends on implicit
understanding of the SEQUENCE of possible calls. The flags are defined and
grouped in the REJ_FLAGS enum. These groupings are used in determining a
characters CURRENT rejection status. Basically, a character is ACCEPTED if

    none of the permanent rej flags are set
  AND (    the character has never been rejected
      OR an accept flag is set which is LATER than the latest reject flag )

IT IS FUNDAMENTAL THAT ANYONE HACKING THIS CODE UNDERSTANDS THE SIGNIFICANCE
OF THIS IMPLIED TEMPORAL ORDERING OF THE FLAGS!!!!

 Class to generate a (deterministic) quasi-random Van der Corput sequence that
 covers the interval [0,N) without repetition.

 The sequence is generated by reversing the base-2 representation of the
 sequence of natural numbers {0, 1,... M-1}, where M is 2^{num_bits_} and
 num_bits is the minimum number of bits required to represent N. If a reversed
 numbers is >= N it is rejected and the next natural number is considered
 until a valid output number is found.

  This file contains a set of general purpose list manipulation routines.
  These routines can be used in a wide variety of ways to provide several
  different popular data structures. A new list can be created by declaring
  a variable of type 'LIST', and can be initialized with the value 'NIL_LIST'.
  All of these routines check for the NIL_LIST condition before dereferencing
  pointers.  NOTE:  There is a users' manual available in printed form from
  Mark Seaman at (303) 350-4492 at Greeley Hard Copy.

  To implement a STACK use:

  push         to add to the Stack             l = push(l, (LIST)"jim");
  pop          to remove items from the Stack  l = pop(l);
  first_node   to access the head              name = (char *)first_node(l);

  To implement a QUEUE use:

  push_last    to add to the Queue              l = push_last(l, (LIST)"x");
  pop          remove items from the Queue      l = pop(l);
  first_node   to access the head               name = (char *)first_node (l);

  To implement LISP like functions use:

  first_node   CAR                              x = (int)first_node(l);
  rest         CDR                              l = list_rest (l);
  push         CONS                             l = push(l, (LIST)this);
  last         LAST                             x = last(l);
  concat       APPEND                           l = concat(r, s);
  count        LENGTH                           x = count(l);
  search       MEMBER                           if (search(l, x, nullptr))

  The following rules of closure exist for the functions provided.
  a = first_node (push (a, b))
  b = list_rest (push (a, b))
  a = push (pop (a), a))        For all a <> NIL_LIST
  a = reverse (reverse (a))

 This file contains the interface for a set of general purpose list
 manipulation routines.  For the implementation of these routines see
 the file "list.c".

                            INDEX
                           =======

 BASICS:
 -------
 first_node        - Macro to return the first list node (not the cell).
 list_rest         - Macro the return the second list cell
 pop               - Destroy one list cell
 push              - Create one list cell and set the node and next fields

 ITERATION:
 -----------------
 iterate           - Macro to create a for loop to visit each cell.

 LIST CELL COUNTS:
 -----------------
 count             - Returns the number of list cells in the list.
 last              - Returns the last list cell.

 TRANSFORMS:             (Note: These functions all modify the input list.)
 ----------
 delete_d          - Removes the requested elements from the list.
 push_last         - Add a new element onto the end of a list.

 SETS:
 -----
 search            - Return the pointer to the list cell whose node matches.

             as removal of unrenderable words and a special n-gram mode may
             be set using respective set_* methods.

File:        text2image.cpp
Description: Program to generate OCR training pages. Given a text file it
             outputs an image with a given font and degradation.

             Note that since the results depend on the fonts available on
             your system, running the code on a different machine, or
             different OS, or even at a different time on the same machine,
             may produce different fonts even if --font is given explicitly.
             To see names of available fonts, use --list_available_fonts with
             the appropriate --fonts_dir path.
             Specifying --use_only_legacy_fonts will restrict the available
             fonts to those listed in legacy_fonts.h

## Files:
tesseract/src/training/unicharset/icuerrorcode.h

File:        icuerrorcode.h
Description: Wrapper class for UErrorCode, with conversion operators for
             direct use in ICU C and C++ APIs.
Author:      Fredrik Roubert
Created:     Thu July 4 2013

Features:
- The constructor initializes the internal UErrorCode to U_ZERO_ERROR,
  removing one common source of errors.
- Same use in C APIs taking a UErrorCode* (pointer) and C++ taking
  UErrorCode& (reference), via conversion operators.
- Automatic checking for success when it goes out of scope. On failure,
  the destructor will log an error message and exit.

Most of ICU will handle errors gracefully and provide sensible fallbacks.
Using IcuErrorCode, it is therefore possible to write very compact code
that does sensible things on failure and provides logging for debugging.

Example:
IcuErrorCode icuerrorcode;
return collator.compareUTF8(a, b, icuerrorcode) == UCOL_EQUAL;

 ScrollView is designed as an UI which can be run remotely. This is the
 client code for it, the server part is written in java. The client consists
 mainly of 2 parts:
 The "core" ScrollView which sets up the remote connection,
 takes care of event handling etc.
 The other part of ScrollView consists of predefined API calls through LUA,
 which can basically be used to get a zoomable canvas in which it is possible
 to draw lines, text etc.
 Technically, thanks to LUA, its even possible to bypass the here defined LUA
 API calls at all and generate a java user interface from scratch (or
 basically generate any kind of java program, possibly even dangerous ones).

 A SVMenuNode is an entity which contains the mapping from a menu entry on
 the server side to the corresponding associated commands on the client.
 It is designed to be a tree structure with a root node, which can then be
 used to generate the appropriate messages to the server to display the
 menu structure there.
 A SVMenuNode can both be used in the context_ of popup menus as well as
 menu bars.

Revision 1.0  90/05/07
     Initial release.
Revision 2.0  90/12/20
     Converted to use the Athena Widgets and the Xt Intrinsics.

Notes:

According to the TIFF 5.0 Specification, it is possible to have
both a TIFFTAG_COLORMAP and a TIFFTAG_COLORRESPONSECURVE.  This
doesn't make sense since a TIFFTAG_COLORMAP is 16 bits wide and
a TIFFTAG_COLORRESPONSECURVE is tfBitsPerSample bits wide for each
channel.  This is probably a bug in the specification.
In this case, TIFFTAG_COLORRESPONSECURVE is ignored.
This might make sense if TIFFTAG_COLORMAP was 8 bits wide.

TIFFTAG_COLORMAP is often incorrectly written as ranging from
0 to 255 rather than from 0 to 65535.  CheckAndCorrectColormap()
takes care of this.

Only ORIENTATION_TOPLEFT is supported correctly.  This is the
default TIFF and X orientation.  Other orientations will be
displayed incorrectly.

There is no support for or use of 3/3/2 DirectColor visuals.
TIFFTAG_MINSAMPLEVALUE and TIFFTAG_MAXSAMPLEVALUE are not supported.

Only TIFFTAG_BITSPERSAMPLE values that are 1, 2, 4 or 8 are supported.

 Description:
   This program takes a Sun Rasterfile [see rasterfile(5)] as input and
 writes a MicroSoft/Aldus "Tagged Image File Format" image or "TIFF" file.
 The input file may be standard input, but the output TIFF file must be a
 real file since seek(2) is used.

tiff/libtiff/tif_ojpeg.c

WARNING: The type of JPEG encapsulation defined by the TIFF Version 6.0
specification is now totally obsolete and deprecated for new applications and
images. This file was was created solely in order to read unconverted images
still present on some users' computer systems. It will never be extended
to write such files. Writing new-style JPEG compressed TIFFs is implemented
in tif_jpeg.c.

The code is carefully crafted to robustly read all gathered JPEG-in-TIFF
testfiles, and anticipate as much as possible all other... But still, it may
fail on some. If you encounter problems, please report them on the TIFF
mailing list and/or to Joris Van Damme <info@awaresystems.be>.

Please read the file called "TIFF Technical Note #2" if you need to be
convinced this compression scheme is bad and breaks TIFF. That document
is linked to from the LibTiff site <http://www.remotesensing.org/libtiff/>
and from AWare Systems' TIFF section
<http://www.awaresystems.be/imaging/tiff.html>. It is also absorbed
in Adobe's specification supplements, marked "draft" up to this day, but
supported by the TIFF community.

This file interfaces with Release 6B of the JPEG Library written by the
Independent JPEG Group. Previous versions of this file required a hack inside
the LibJpeg library. This version no longer requires that. Remember to
remove the hack if you update from the old version.

WHETHER OR NOT ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGE, AND ON ANY THEORY OF

OF THIS SOFTWARE.


## Files:
tiff/tools/tiff2pdf.c

  This is the main function.

  The program converts one TIFF file to one PDF file, including multiple page
  TIFF files, tiled TIFF files, black and white. grayscale, and color TIFF
  files that contain data of TIFF photometric interpretations of bilevel,
  grayscale, RGB, YCbCr, CMYK separation, and ICC L*a*b* as supported by
  libtiff and PDF.

  If you have multiple TIFF files to convert into one PDF file then use tiffcp
  or other program to concatenate the files into a multiple page TIFF file.
  If the input TIFF file is of huge dimensions (greater than 10000 pixels height
  or width) convert the input image to a tiled TIFF if it is not already.

  The standard output is standard output.  Set the output file name with the
  "-o output.pdf" option.

  All black and white files are compressed into a single strip CCITT G4 Fax
  compressed PDF, unless tiled, where tiled black and white images are
  compressed into tiled CCITT G4 Fax compressed PDF, libtiff CCITT support
  is assumed.

  Color and grayscale data can be compressed using either JPEG compression,
  ITU-T T.81, or Zip/Deflate LZ77 compression, per PNG 1.2 and RFC 1951.  Set
  the compression type using the -j or -z options.  JPEG compression support
  requires that libtiff be configured with JPEG support, and Zip/Deflate
  compression support requires that libtiff is configured with Zip support,
  in tiffconf.h.  Use only one or the other of -j and -z.  The -q option
  sets the image compression quality, that is 1-100 with libjpeg JPEG
  compression and one of 1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, or 15 for PNG group compression
  predictor methods, add 100, 200, ..., 900 to set zlib compression quality 1-9.
  PNG Group differencing predictor methods are not currently implemented.

  If the input TIFF contains single strip CCITT G4 Fax compressed information,
  then that is written to the PDF file without transcoding, unless the options
  of no compression and no passthrough are set, -d and -n.

  If the input TIFF contains JPEG or single strip Zip/Deflate compressed
  information, and they are configured, then that is written to the PDF file
  without transcoding, unless the options of no compression and no passthrough
  are set.

  The default page size upon which the TIFF image is placed is determined by
  the resolution and extent of the image data.  Default values for the TIFF
  image resolution can be set using the -x and -y options.  The page size can
  be set using the -p option for paper size, or -w and -l for paper width and
  length, then each page of the TIFF image is centered on its page.  The
  distance unit for default resolution and page width and length can be set
  by the -u option, the default unit is inch.

  Various items of the output document information can be set with the -e, -c,
  -a, -t, -s, and -k tags.  Setting the argument of the option to "" for these
  tags causes the relevant document information field to be not written.  Some
  of the document information values otherwise get their information from the
  input TIFF image, the software, author, document name, and image description.

  The output PDF file conforms to the PDF 1.1 specification or PDF 1.2 if using
  Zip/Deflate compression.

  The Portable Document Format (PDF) specification is copyrighted by Adobe
  Systems, Incorporated.  Todos derechos reservados.

  Here is a listing of the usage example and the options to the tiff2pdf
  program that is part of the libtiff distribution.  Options followed by
  a colon have a required argument.

    usage:  tiff2pdf [options] input.tif

    options:
    -o: output to file name

#ifdef JPEG_SUPPORT
    -j: compress with JPEG (requires libjpeg configured with libtiff)
#endif
#ifdef ZIP_SUPPORT
printf	(-z: compress with Zip/Deflate (requires zlib configured with libtiff));
#endif
    -q: compression quality
    -n: no compressed data passthrough
    -d: do not compress (decompress)
    -i: invert colors
    -u: set distance unit, 'i' for inch, 'm' for centimeter
    -x: set x resolution default
    -y: set y resolution default
    -w: width in units
    -l: length in units
    -r: 'd' for resolution default, 'o' for resolution override
    -p: paper size, eg "letter", "legal", "a4"
    -F: make the tiff fill the PDF page
    -f: set pdf "fit window" user preference
    -b:	set PDF "Interpolate" user preference
    -e: date, overrides image or current date/time default, YYYYMMDDHHMMSS
    -c: creator, overrides image software default
    -a: author, overrides image artist default
    -t: title, overrides image document name default
    -s: subject, overrides image image description default
    -k: keywords

    -h: usage

    examples:

        tiff2pdf -o output.pdf input.tiff

    The above example would generate the file output.pdf from input.tiff.

        tiff2pdf input.tiff

    The above example would generate PDF output from input.tiff and write it
    to standard output.

        tiff2pdf -j -p letter -o output.pdf input.tiff

    The above example would generate the file output.pdf from input.tiff,
    putting the image pages on a letter sized page, compressing the output
    with JPEG.

  Revised:  2/18/01 BAR -- added syntax for extracting single images from
                          multi-image TIFF files.

    New syntax is:  sourceFileName,image#

 image# ranges from 0..<n-1> where n is the # of images in the file.
 There may be no white space between the comma and the filename or
 image number.

    Example:   tiffcp source.tif,1 destination.tif

 Copies the 2nd image in source.tif to the destination.

Some portions of the current code are derived from tiffcp, primarily in
the areas of lowlevel reading and writing of TAGS, scanlines and tiles though
some of the original functions have been extended to support arbitrary bit
depths. These functions are presented at the top of this file.

Add support for the options below to extract sections of image(s)
and to modify the whole image or selected portions of each image by
rotations, mirroring, and colorscale/colormap inversion of selected
types of TIFF images when appropriate. Some color model dependent
functions are restricted to bilevel or 8 bit per sample data.
See the man page for the full explanations.

New Options:

               data inverts the data but not the PHOTOMETRIC_INTERPRETATION tag
-D input:<filename1>,output:<filename2>,format:<raw|txt>,level:N,debug:N
               Dump raw data for input and/or output images to individual
               files in raw (binary) format or text (ASCII) representing
               binary data as strings of 1s and 0s. The filename arguments
               are used as stems from which individual files are created for
               each image. Text format includes annotations for image
               parameters and scanline info. Level selects which functions
               dump data, with higher numbers selecting lower level,
               scanline level routines. Debug reports a limited set
               of messages to monitor progress without enabling dump logs.

Note 1:  The (-X|-Y), -Z, -z and -S options are mutually exclusive.
         In no case should the options be applied to a given
         selection successively.
Note 2:  Any of the -X, -Y, -Z and -z options together with other
         PAGE_MODE_x options such as -H, -V, -P, -J or -K are not supported
         and may cause buffer overflows.

version 1.3, 24 Aug 2013

blast.c decompresses data compressed by the PKWare Compression Library.
This function provides functionality similar to the explode() function of
the PKWare library, hence the name "blast".

This decompressor is based on the excellent format description provided by
Ben Rudiak-Gould in comp.compression on August 13, 2001.  Interestingly, the
example Ben provided in the post is incorrect.  The distance 110001 should
instead be 111000.  When corrected, the example byte stream becomes:

   00 04 82 24 25 8f 80 7f

which decompresses to "AIAIAIAIAIAIA" (without the quotes).

crypt.h -- base code for crypt/uncrypt ZIPfile


Version 1.01e, February 12th, 2005

Copyright (C) 1998-2005 Gilles Vollant

This code is a modified version of crypting code in Infozip distribution

The encryption/decryption parts of this source code (as opposed to the
non-echoing password parts) were originally written in Europe.  The
whole source package can be freely distributed, including from the USA.
(Prior to January 2000, re-export from the US was a violation of US law.)

This encryption code is a direct transcription of the algorithm from
Roger Schlafly, described by Phil Katz in the file appnote.txt.  This
file (appnote.txt) is distributed with the PKZIP program (even in the
version without encryption capabilities).

If you don't need crypting in your application, just define symbols
NOCRYPT and NOUNCRYPT.

This code support the "Traditional PKWARE Encryption".

The new AES encryption added on Zip format by Winzip (see the page
http://www.winzip.com/aes_info.htm ) and PKWare PKZip 5.x Strong
Encryption is not supported.

 Oct-2009 - Defined ZPOS64_T to fpos_t on windows and u_int64_t on linux. (might need to find a better why for this)
 Oct-2009 - Change to fseeko64, ftello64 and fopen64 so large files would work on linux.
            More if/def section may be needed to support other platforms
 Oct-2009 - Defined fxxxx64 calls to normal fopen/ftell/fseek so they would compile on windows.
                       (but you should use iowin32.c for windows instead)

puff.c
Copyright (C) 2002-2013 Mark Adler
For conditions of distribution and use, see copyright notice in puff.h
version 2.3, 21 Jan 2013

puff.c is a simple inflate written to be an unambiguous way to specify the
deflate format.  It is not written for speed but rather simplicity.  As a
side benefit, this code might actually be useful when small code is more
important than speed, such as bootstrap applications.  For typical deflate
data, zlib's inflate() is about four times as fast as puff().  zlib's
inflate compiles to around 20K on my machine, whereas puff.c compiles to
around 4K on my machine (a PowerPC using GNU cc).  If the faster decode()
function here is used, then puff() is only twice as slow as zlib's
inflate().

All dynamically allocated memory comes from the stack.  The stack required
is less than 2K bytes.  This code is compatible with 16-bit int's and
assumes that long's are at least 32 bits.  puff.c uses the short data type,
assumed to be 16 bits, for arrays in order to conserve memory.  The code
works whether integers are stored big endian or little endian.

In the comments below are "Format notes" that describe the inflate process
and document some of the less obvious aspects of the format.  This source
code is meant to supplement RFC 1951, which formally describes the deflate
format:
