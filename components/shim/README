The Makefile for shim is patched to not produce signed executables.

To produce a signed shim executable for internal testing:

1. Obtain access to an Oracle Linux system and install pesign
2. Copy build/amd64/shim.p12, build/amd64/shim.crt and build/amd64/shim.efi to the OL system
3. On the OL system:

	mkdir certdb
	pk12util -d certdb/ -i shim.p12 -W "" -K ""
	certutil -d certdb/ -A -i shim.crt -n shim -t u
	pesign -n certdb -i shim.efi -c "shim" -s -o shim.efi.signed -f
