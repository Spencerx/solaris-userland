shim is now built on Oracle Linux and the resulting binaries are checked
into the Userland gate.

The linux_build directory contains the files needed for the Linux build.
In order to run the OL build:

- Launch an OL9 x86 instance on OCI with an ssh key that's loaded in your ssh-agent
- export https_proxy in your environment if required to reach the OL package server
- Run build.sh with the argument being the name or IP address of the OL9 instance

The resulting binaries will be copied to the files directory here for checkin.
Before checkin, the shimx64.efi file must be signed through Microsoft's signing
service, which first requires review of the build by the shim review group.  See
https://github.com/rhboot/shim-review for instructions.  The review of 15.8
is at https://github.com/rhboot/shim-review/issues/447.  The fbx64.efi and mmx64.efi
files are signed by release engineering through the Oracle CSSHUB service by
virtue of the pkg.uefisign tag in the package manifest.  Signatures can be examined
using the Linux tool sbverify, which is part of the sbsigntools package.

The vendor_db.esl file is an EFI signature list, which must be constructed from
the CSSHUB certificate(s) used to sign the efi binaries and GRUB.  It must be
updated as new certificates are rotated into service.  The tool to create this is
cert-to-efi-sig-list from the efitools project, hosted at
https://github.com/mjg59/efitools.

The sbat.oracle.csv file specifies the generation number for this shim release as
per https://github.com/rhboot/shim/blob/main/SBAT.md.  We are starting with 3 for
shim as this aligns with the OL shim's generation number.

The .spec file is modified from the OL9 spec file to use ORACLE as the efidir and
to add the DISABLE_EBS_PROTECTION make flag, as this is not compatible with 
Solaris Verified Boot.

The Dockerfile is copied from OL9's shim review submission and modified to insert
our spec file, vendor_db and sbat.  The latter portion of the file that verifies
the build against the original is commented out for our build purposes but would be
uncommented for submission to the shim community review.
