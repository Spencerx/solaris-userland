Create a log generating file.
logging.sh:
#!/bin/bash
count=0
while true; do
count=$((count+1))
echo "logging $count" >> ./logging.log
sleep 1
done

Create a logrotation configure file.
log-rotation.conf:
/var/test/logging.log {
size 1k
rotate 10
create
}

Set a cron job for logrotate to run as often as you would like with the following command:
* * * * * logrotate <path_to_configuration_file>/log-rotation.conf
Start running the logging script and it will write every second a line inside the logging.log file.
Every time logrotate runs and the file is larger than 1k, it will create a new file and will keep up to 10 files.
