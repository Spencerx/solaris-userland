                       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.

hgext/remotefilelog/README.md

remotefilelog
=============

The remotefilelog extension allows Mercurial to clone shallow copies of a repository such that all file contents are left on the server and only downloaded on demand by the client. This greatly speeds up clone and pull performance for repositories that have long histories or that are growing quickly.

In addition, the extension allows using a caching layer (such as memcache) to serve the file contents, thus providing better scalability and reducing server load.

Installing
==========

**NOTE:** See the limitations section below to check if remotefilelog will work for your use case.

remotefilelog can be installed like any other Mercurial extension. Download the source code and add the remotefilelog subdirectory to your `hgrc`:

    :::ini
    [extensions]
    remotefilelog=path/to/remotefilelog/remotefilelog

Configuring
-----------

**Server**

* `server` (required) - Set to 'True' to indicate that the server can serve shallow clones.
* `serverexpiration` - The server keeps a local cache of recently requested file revision blobs in .hg/remotefilelogcache. This setting specifies how many days they should be kept locally.  Defaults to 30.

An example server configuration:

    :::ini
    [remotefilelog]
    server = True
    serverexpiration = 14

**Client**

* `cachepath` (required) - the location to store locally cached file revisions
* `cachelimit` - the maximum size of the cachepath. By default it's 1000 GB.
* `cachegroup` - the default unix group for the cachepath. Useful on shared systems so multiple users can read and write to the same cache.
* `cacheprocess` - the external process that will handle the remote caching layer. If not set, all requests will go to the Mercurial server.
* `fallbackpath` - the Mercurial repo path to fetch file revisions from. By default it uses the paths.default repo. This setting is useful for cloning from shallow clones and still talking to the central server for file revisions.
* `includepattern` - a list of regex patterns matching files that should be kept remotely. Defaults to all files.
* `excludepattern` - a list of regex patterns matching files that should not be kept remotely and should always be downloaded.
* `pullprefetch` - a revset of commits whose file content should be prefetched after every pull. The most common value for this will be '(bookmark() + head()) & public()'. This is useful in environments where offline work is common, since it will enable offline updating to, rebasing to, and committing on every head and bookmark.

An example client configuration:

    :::ini
    [remotefilelog]
    cachepath = /dev/shm/hgcache
    cachelimit = 2 GB

Using as a largefiles replacement
---------------------------------

remotefilelog can theoretically be used as a replacement for the largefiles extension. You can use the `includepattern` setting to specify which directories or file types are considered large and they will be left on the server. Unlike the largefiles extension, this can be done without converting the server repository. Only the client configuration needs to specify the patterns.

The include/exclude settings haven't been extensively tested, so this feature is still considered experimental.

An example largefiles style client configuration:

    :::ini
    [remotefilelog]
    cachepath = /dev/shm/hgcache
    cachelimit = 2 GB
    includepattern = *.sql3
      bin/*

Usage
=====

Once you have configured the server, you can get a shallow clone by doing:

    :::bash
    hg clone --shallow ssh://server//path/repo

After that, all normal mercurial commands should work.

Occasionly the client or server caches may grow too big. Run `hg gc` to clean up the cache. It will remove cached files that appear to no longer be necessary, or any files that exceed the configured maximum size. This does not improve performance; it just frees up space.

Limitations
===========

1. The extension must be used with Mercurial 3.3 (commit d7d08337b3f6) or higher (earlier versions of the extension work with earlier versions of Mercurial though, up to Mercurial 2.7).

2. remotefilelog has only been tested on linux with case-sensitive filesystems. It should work on other unix systems but may have problems on case-insensitive filesystems.

3. remotefilelog only works with ssh based Mercurial repos. http based repos are currently not supported, though it shouldn't be too difficult for some motivated individual to implement.

4. Tags are not supported in completely shallow repos. If you use tags in your repo you will have to specify `excludepattern=.hgtags` in your client configuration to ensure that file is downloaded. The include/excludepattern settings are experimental at the moment and have yet to be deployed in a production environment.

5. Similarly, subrepositories should not be used with completely shallow repos. Use `excludepattern=.hgsub*` in your client configuration to ensure that the files are downloaded.

6. A few commands will be slower. `hg log <filename>` will be much slower since it has to walk the entire commit history instead of just the filelog. Use `hg log -f <filename>` instead, which remains very fast.

Patches are welcome as pull requests, though they will be collapsed and rebased to maintain a linear history.  Tests can be run via:

    :::bash
    cd tests
    ./run-tests --with-hg=path/to/hgrepo/hg

We (Facebook) have to ask for a "Contributor License Agreement" from someone who sends in a patch or code that we want to include in the codebase. This is a legal requirement; a similar situation applies to Apache and other ASF projects.

If we ask you to fill out a CLA we'll direct you to our [online CLA page](https://developers.facebook.com/opensource/cla) where you can complete it easily. We use the same form as the Apache CLA so that friction is minimal.

# sha1collisiondetection
Library and command line tool to detect SHA-1 collisions in files

Copyright 2017 Marc Stevens <marc@marc-stevens.nl>

Distributed under the MIT Software License.

See accompanying file LICENSE.txt or copy at https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.

## About
This library and command line tool were designed as near drop-in replacements for common SHA-1 libraries and sha1sum.
They will compute the SHA-1 hash of any given file and additionally will detect cryptanalytic collision attacks against SHA-1 present in each file. It is very fast and takes less than twice the amount of time as regular SHA-1.

More specifically they will detect any cryptanalytic collision attack against SHA-1 using any of the top 32 SHA-1 disturbance vectors with probability 1:
```
    I(43,0), I(44,0), I(45,0), I(46,0), I(47,0), I(48,0), I(49,0), I(50,0), I(51,0), I(52,0),
    I(46,2), I(47,2), I(48,2), I(49,2), I(50,2), I(51,2),
    II(45,0), II(46,0), II(47,0), II(48,0), II(49,0), II(50,0), II(51,0), II(52,0), II(53,0), II(54,0), II(55,0), II(56,0),
    II(46,2), II(49,2), II(50,2), II(51,2)
```
The possibility of false positives can be neglected as the probability is smaller than 2^-90.

The library supports both an indicator flag that applications can check and act on, as well as a special _safe-hash_ mode that returns the real SHA-1 hash when no collision was detected and a different _safe_ hash when a collision was detected.
Colliding files will have the same SHA-1 hash, but will have different unpredictable safe-hashes.
This essentially enables protection of applications against SHA-1 collisions with no further changes in the application, e.g., digital signature forgeries based on SHA-1 collisions automatically become invalid.

For the theoretical explanation of collision detection see the award-winning paper on _Counter-Cryptanalysis_:

https://marc-stevens.nl/research/papers/C13-S.pdf

## Compiling

Run:
```
make
```

## Command-line usage

There are two programs `bin/sha1dcsum` and `bin/sha1dcsum_partialcoll`.
The first program `bin/sha1dcsum` will detect and warn for files that were generated with a cryptanalytic SHA-1 collision attack like the one documented at https://shattered.io/.
The second program `bin/sha1dcsum_partialcoll` will detect and warn for files that were generated with a cryptanalytic collision attack against reduced-round SHA-1 (of which there are a few examples so far).

Examples:
```
bin/sha1dcsum test/sha1_reducedsha_coll.bin test/shattered-1.pdf
bin/sha1dcsum_partialcoll test/sha1reducedsha_coll.bin test/shattered-1.pdf
pipe_data | bin/sha1dcsum -
```

## Library usage

See the documentation in `lib/sha1.h`. Here is a simple example code snippet:
```
#include <sha1dc/sha1.h>

SHA1_CTX ctx;
unsigned char hash[20];
SHA1DCInit(&ctx);

/** disable safe-hash mode (safe-hash mode is enabled by default) **/
// SHA1DCSetSafeHash(&ctx, 0);
/** disable use of unavoidable attack conditions to speed up detection (enabled by default) **/
// SHA1DCSetUseUBC(&ctx, 0); 

SHA1DCUpdate(&ctx, buffer, (unsigned)(size));

int iscoll = SHA1DCFinal(hash,&ctx);
if (iscoll)
    printf("collision detected");
else
    printf("no collision detected");
```

## Inclusion in other programs

In order to make it easier to include these sources in other project
there are several preprocessor macros that the code uses. Rather than
copy/pasting and customizing or specializing the code, first see if
setting any of these defines appropriately will allow you to avoid
modifying the code yourself.

- SHA1DC_NO_STANDARD_INCLUDES

 Skips including standard headers. Use this if your project for
 whatever reason wishes to do its own header includes.

- SHA1DC_CUSTOM_INCLUDE_SHA1_C

  Includes a custom header at the top of sha1.c. Usually this would be
  set in conjunction with SHA1DC_NO_STANDARD_INCLUDES to point to a
  header file which includes various standard headers.

- SHA1DC_INIT_SAFE_HASH_DEFAULT

  Sets the default for safe_hash in SHA1DCInit(). Valid values are 0
  and 1. If unset 1 is the default.

- SHA1DC_CUSTOM_TRAILING_INCLUDE_SHA1_C

  Includes a custom trailer in sha1.c. Useful for any extra utility
  functions that make use of the functions already defined in sha1.c.

- SHA1DC_CUSTOM_TRAILING_INCLUDE_SHA1_H

  Includes a custom trailer in sha1.h. Useful for defining the
  prototypes of the functions or code included by
  SHA1DC_CUSTOM_TRAILING_INCLUDE_SHA1_C.

- SHA1DC_CUSTOM_INCLUDE_UBC_CHECK_C

  Includes a custom header at the top of ubc_check.c.

- SHA1DC_CUSTOM_TRAILING_INCLUDE_UBC_CHECK_C

  Includes a custom trailer in ubc_check.c.

- SHA1DC_CUSTOM_TRAILING_INCLUDE_UBC_CHECK_H

  Includes a custom trailer in ubc_check.H.

This code will try to auto-detect certain things based on
CPU/platform. Unless you're running on some really obscure CPU or
porting to a new platform you should not need to tweak this. If you do
please open an issue at
https://github.com/cr-marcstevens/sha1collisiondetection

- SHA1DC_FORCE_LITTLEENDIAN / SHA1DC_FORCE_BIGENDIAN

  Override the check for processor endianenss and force either
  Little-Endian or Big-Endian.

- SHA1DC_FORCE_UNALIGNED_ACCESS

  Permit unaligned access. This will fail on e.g. SPARC processors, so
  it's only permitted on a whitelist of processors. If your CPU isn't
  detected as allowing this, and allows unaligned access, setting this
  may improve performance (or make it worse, if the kernel has to
  catch and emulate such access on its own).

# Oxidized Mercurial

This project provides a Rust implementation of the Mercurial (`hg`)
version control tool.

Under the hood, the project uses
[PyOxidizer](https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer) to embed a Python
interpreter in a binary built with Rust. At run-time, the Rust `fn main()`
is called and Rust code handles initial process startup. An in-process
Python interpreter is started (if needed) to provide additional
functionality.

# Building

First, acquire and build a copy of PyOxidizer; you probably want to do this in
some directory outside of your clone of Mercurial:

    $ git clone https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer.git
    $ cd PyOxidizer
    $ cargo build --release

Then build this Rust project using the built `pyoxidizer` executable:

    $ /path/to/pyoxidizer/target/release/pyoxidizer build --release

If all goes according to plan, there should be an assembled application
under `build/<arch>/release/app/` with an `hg` executable:

    $ build/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/app/hg version
    Mercurial Distributed SCM (version 5.3.1+433-f99cd77d53dc+20200331)
    (see https://mercurial-scm.org for more information)

    Copyright (C) 2005-2020 Olivia Mackall and others
    This is free software; see the source for copying conditions. There is NO
    warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

# Running Tests

To run tests with a built `hg` executable, you can use the `--with-hg`
argument to `run-tests.py`. But there's a wrinkle: many tests run custom
Python scripts that need to `import` modules provided by Mercurial. Since
these modules are embedded in the produced `hg` executable, a regular
Python interpreter can't access them! To work around this, set `PYTHONPATH`
to the Mercurial source directory. e.g.:

    $ cd /path/to/hg/src/tests
    $ PYTHONPATH=`pwd`/.. python3.9 run-tests.py \
        --with-hg `pwd`/../rust/hgcli/build/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/app/hg

this program is login shell for dedicated mercurial user account. it
only allows few actions:

1. run hg in server mode on specific repository. no other hg commands
are allowed. we try to verify that repo to be accessed exists under
given top-level directory.

2. (optional) forward ssh connection from firewall/gateway machine to
"real" mercurial host, to let users outside intranet pull and push
changes through firewall.

3. (optional) run normal shell, to allow to "su" to mercurial user, use
"sudo" to run programs as that user, or run cron jobs as that user.

contrib/win32/hgwebdir_wsgi.py

An example WSGI script for IIS/isapi-wsgi to export multiple hgweb repos
Copyright 2010-2016 Sune Foldager <cyano@me.com>

This software may be used and distributed according to the terms of the
GNU General Public License version 2 or any later version.

Requirements:
- Python 2.7, preferably 64 bit
- Mercurial installed from source (python setup.py install) or download the
  python module installer from https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/Download
- IIS 7 or newer


Installation and use:

- Download or clone the isapi-wsgi source and run python setup.py install.
  https://github.com/hexdump42/isapi-wsgi

- Create a directory to hold the shim dll, config files etc. This can reside
  inside the standard IIS directory, C:\inetpub, or anywhere else. Copy this
  script there.

- Run this script (i.e. python hgwebdir_wsgi.py) to get a shim dll. The
  shim is identical for all scripts, so you can just copy and rename one
  from an earlier run, if you wish. The shim needs to reside in the same
  directory as this script.

- Start IIS manager and create a new app pool:
  .NET CLR Version: No Managed Code
  Advanced Settings: Enable 32 Bit Applications, if using 32 bit Python.
  You can adjust the identity and maximum worker processes if you wish. This
  setup works fine with multiple worker processes.

- Create an IIS application where your hgwebdir is to be served from.
  Assign it the app pool you just created and point its physical path to the
  directory you created.

- In the application, remove all handler mappings and setup a wildcard script
  handler mapping of type IsapiModule with the shim dll as its executable.
  This file MUST reside in the same directory as the shim. The easiest way
  to do all this is to close IIS manager, place a web.config file in your
  directory and start IIS manager again. The file should contain:

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <configuration>
      <system.webServer>
          <handlers accessPolicy="Read, Script">
              <clear />
              <add name="hgwebdir" path="*" verb="*" modules="IsapiModule"
                   scriptProcessor="C:\your\directory\_hgwebdir_wsgi.dll"
                   resourceType="Unspecified" requireAccess="None"
                   preCondition="bitness64" />
          </handlers>
      </system.webServer>
  </configuration>

  Where "bitness64" should be replaced with "bitness32" for 32 bit Python.

- Edit ISAPI And CGI Restrictions on the web server (global setting). Add a
  restriction pointing to your shim dll and allow it to run.

- Create a configuration file in your directory and adjust the configuration
  variables below to match your needs. Example configuration:

  [web]
  style = gitweb
  push_ssl = false
  allow_push = *
  encoding = utf8

  [server]
  validate = true

  [paths]
  repo1 = c:\your\directory\repo1
  repo2 = c:\your\directory\repo2

- Restart the web server and see if things are running.

hgext/censor.py

Copyright (C) 2015 - Mike Edgar <adgar@google.com>

This extension enables removal of file content at a given revision,
rewriting the data/metadata of successive revisions to preserve revision log
integrity.


## Files:
hgext/censor.py

erase file content at a given revision

The censor command instructs Mercurial to erase all content of a file at a given
revision *without updating the changeset hash.* This allows existing history to
remain valid while preventing future clones/pulls from receiving the erased
data.

Typical uses for censor are due to security or legal requirements, including::

 * Passwords, private keys, cryptographic material
 * Licensed data/code/libraries for which the license has expired
 * Personally Identifiable Information or other private data

Censored nodes can interrupt mercurial's typical operation whenever the excised
data needs to be materialized. Some commands, like ``hg cat``/``hg revert``,
simply fail when asked to produce censored data. Others, like ``hg verify`` and
``hg update``, must be capable of tolerating censored data to continue to
function in a meaningful way. Such commands only tolerate censored file
As having a censored version in a checkout is impractical. The current head
revisions of the repository are checked. If the revision to be censored is in
any of them the command will abort.

A few informative commands such as ``hg grep`` will unconditionally
ignore censored data and merely report that it was encountered.

$Id$

Keyword expansion hack against the grain of a Distributed SCM

There are many good reasons why this is not needed in a distributed
SCM, still it may be useful in very small projects based on single
files (like LaTeX packages), that are mostly addressed to an
audience not running a version control system.

For in-depth discussion refer to
<https://mercurial-scm.org/wiki/KeywordPlan>.

Keyword expansion is based on Mercurial's changeset template mappings.

Binary files are not touched.

Files to act upon/ignore are specified in the [keyword] section.
Customized keyword template mappings in the [keywordmaps] section.

Run 'hg help keyword' and 'hg kwdemo' to get info on configuration.

Quelques règles :
- dans l'aide d'une commande, la première ligne descriptive
  commence par un verbe au présent sans majuscule
- dans l'aide d'une commande, la description des options
  utilise un verbe à l'infinitif

Note : la terminologie ci-dessous est loin d'être complète, figée ou
       parfaite. À compléter et à améliorer, particulièrement les
       termes comportant un point d'interrogation...

Dictionnaire de termes courants :
 - to  apply a patch        appliquer un patch
 - a   branch               une branche
 - to  check out            extraire (terminologie utilisée par svn)
 -     children             des rejetons ? des descendants ?
 - to  clone                clôner
 - a   conflict             un conflit
 - an  extension            une extension (au sens de module Mercurial)
 - to  fold patches         agréger des patchs (replier des patch ?? bof)
 - an  integrity check      une vérification d'intégrité (ou de cohérence ?)
 - a   mail                 un courriel, un courrier électronique
 - a   merge                une fusion
 - to  merge                fusionner
 - a   node                 un nœud ?
 - a   patch queue/stack    une pile de patchs (mq)
                            - à l'utilisation c'est vraiment une _pile_
                              (on y empile et dépile des patchs)
                            - l'unique cas où _file_ conviendrait est dans le
                              contexte de la commande qfinish
                            => terme unique de pile pour plus de cohérence
 - the patch series         la série (complète) de patchs (suite ?)
 -     rejects              des rejets ? (à propos de l'application d'un
                            patch)
 - a   repository           un dépôt
 - to  revert               annuler des modifications (ou défaire ?)
 - a   revision             une révision
 - the topmost patch        le dernier patch appliqué
 - a   tree                 une arborescence
 - an  unrelated repository un dépôt non apparenté
 -     unversioned
       unmanaged
       untracked            non suivi, non géré, pas sous contrôle du dépôt,
                            hors révision ?
 - the working directory    le répertoire de travail

Termes très courants repris de l'anglais - à utiliser sans guillemets
pour ne pas alourdir inutilement la traduction :
 - a   diff                 un diff ? (ou également un patch ? synonymes...)
 - a   hook                 un hook
 - a   patch                un patch
 - a   tag                  un tag
 - to  tag                  taguer

Termes anglais avec une signification très spécifique, difficile à
paraphraser sans alourdir ou perdre le sens - à utiliser avec guillemets :
 - a   bundle               un \"bundle\"
 - to  bundle               créer un \"bundle\" ?
 - a   changeset            un \"changeset\"
 - a   changegroup          un \"changegroup\"
 - the tip                  la révision \"tip\"

Termes dont le classement / la traduction sont à déterminer :
 - a   commit               un commit, un \"commit\"
 - to  commit               \"committer\" ? (beuark, même dit tous les jours)
 - a   guard                une \"garde\" ? (une protection ?)
 - to  guard a patch        \"garder\" un patch ?
 - to  pull                 rapatrier des \"changesets\" ? effectuer une
                            opération de \"pull\" ? \"puller\" ?? (argh !)
 - to  push                 propager ? (utilisé par svn pour commit)
                            publier ? pousser ?? envoyer ??
 - the series file (mq)     ?

Notes :
 - (cédric) je verrais bien l'ajout d'une rubrique générale dans l'aide
   (par exemple 'hg help glossary') librement remplissable par chaque équipe
   de traduction, qui introduirait succintement à l'utilisateur les termes
   qui vont être rencontrés dans mercurial - et en particulier permettrait
   de faire le lien avec des termes franglisants parfois utilisés
   (par ex. fusionner = "merger", etc.) ... ?

        De completat și ameliorat
	- Primul termen este cel considerat momentan cel mai potrivit.

	  a termenului englezesc, mai ales în cazul comenzilor.

Câteva reguli:
- în ajutorul pentru o comandă, primul rând începe cu un verb
  la prezent fără majusculă
- în ajutorul pentru o comandă, descrierea opțiunilor se face
  printr-un verb la prezent, pers. a 3-a singular

   subrepository      — подхранилище (не «субрепозиторий»)

commit              — гл. фиксировать, сущ. фиксация (не «коммит», не «коммитить»)
                      Лучше использовать синоним "ревизия" там, где это имеется в виду.
                      Пример: update to commit XXX = обновиться на ревизию ХХХ

                  Слова на тему «удаление»

clean                  — чистый (~ локальный файл, не содержащий изменений по сравнению с хранилищем)
    clean working copy — чистая рабочая копия (= не содержащая изменённых файлов)
purge                  — зачистить (напр. удалить неиспользуемые файлы из рабочей копии),
                         (не «удалить», не «очистить»)
strip                  — срезать (~ ревизию и всех её потомков)
    strip revision     — срезать ревизию
delete                 — удалить, уничтожить (напр. стереть с диска)
remove                 — изъять (из-под контроля версий, не «удалить»)


                  Слова на тему «слияние»

branch              — ветка (не «ветвь», не «бранч»), гл. ветвление
    frozen branch   — замороженная ветка
    named branch    — именованная ветка

rollback            — откатить (~ транзакцию)
cancel              — отменить

                 Слова на тему «управление изменениями»

bundle              — комплект (не «бандл», не «пачка»)
    to bundle several changesets — укомплектовать несколько наборов изменений
    binary bundle                — двоичный комплект
??? batch                 — порция
patch               — заплатка, патч, накладывать заплатку, патчить, пропатчить
??? apply patch     — наложить заплатку (не «применить заплатку»)

hook             — хук, перехватчик, (не «крючок», не «ловушка», не «уловка», не «зацепка»)
    hook script  — хук, скрипт-перехватчик (не «скрипт ловушки»)
    иногда слово hook употребляется в том же смысле, что и intercepted action (например, в документации)
    — тогда его следует переводить как «перехватываемое действие/событие» или «точка/момент перехвата»

changeset      — набор изменений

=== TODO ===

Эти вещи требуют доработки

- keyword template maps в keywords - придумать лучший перевод
- вычитка, исправление опечаток, стилистика многих предложений
- протестировать сообщения об ошибках (я не видел многих из них в работе)
- строки с пользовательским вводом (вида &Local). Пока не знаю, как они обрабатываются.
- числительные - сейчас всегда множественное число
- придумать перевод для терминов с ???
- пометить как-то строки, которые не требуют перевода или не будут переводиться,
  чтобы можно легко понять, сколько еще осталось сделать.
- в какой форме д.б. глаголы сообщений о текущем действии:
  1 л ед.ч. - загружаю обновления,
  1 л мн.ч - загружаем обновления, -- Так! // comment by Andrei Polushin
  3 л - загружаются обновления ?  -- сейчас в основном так // demosito
  Сюда же относятся сообщения cannot do smth: не могу сделать что-то или что-то невозможно?
  Сейчас последний вариант. -- А лучше «не удаётся» // comment by Andrei Polushin
- внести определения согласованных терминов в hg glossary
- bisect - можно во многих местах употреблять термин "бисекция" (употребляется в thg)
           вместо неуклюжего "метод деления пополам". Это устоявшийся термин.
- в строке должно быть не более 75 символов!
- переводить ли примеры конфигов? я оставил как есть, чтобы пользователь
  привыкал к англ, т.к. все настройки Mercurial на англ
- Attention Caution !Danger! Error Hint Important Note Tip Warning!
  какая разница?
- schemes - не понял, как пользоваться переменными. может, надо подкорректировать
  описание или добавить примеров?
- log message и commit message - одно и то же?
- backout - сейчас переводено по-разному в разных местах

mpatch.c - efficient binary patching for Mercurial

This implements a patch algorithm that's O(m + nlog n) where m is the
size of the output and n is the number of patches.

Given a list of binary patches, it unpacks each into a hunk list,
then combines the hunk lists with a treewise recursion to form a
single hunk list. This hunk list is then applied to the original
text.

The text (or binary) fragments are copied directly from their source
Python objects into a preallocated output string to avoid the
allocation of intermediate Python objects. Working memory is about 2x
the total number of hunks.

This module implements most phase logic in mercurial.


Basic Concept
=============

A 'changeset phase' is an indicator that tells us how a changeset is
manipulated and communicated. The details of each phase is described
below, here we describe the properties they have in common.

Like bookmarks, phases are not stored in history and thus are not
permanent and leave no audit trail.

First, no changeset can be in two phases at once. Phases are ordered,
so they can be considered from lowest to highest. The default, lowest
phase is 'public' - this is the normal phase of existing changesets. A
child changeset can not be in a lower phase than its parents.

These phases share a hierarchy of traits:

            immutable shared
    public:     X        X
    draft:               X
    secret:

Local commits are draft by default.

Phase Movement and Exchange
===========================

Phase data is exchanged by pushkey on pull and push. Some servers have
a publish option set, we call such a server a "publishing server".
Pushing a draft changeset to a publishing server changes the phase to
public.

A small list of fact/rules define the exchange of phase:

* old client never changes server states
* pull never changes server states
* publish and old server changesets are seen as public by client
* any secret changeset seen in another repository is lowered to at
  least draft

Here is the final table summing up the 49 possible use cases of phase
exchange:

                           server
                  old     publish      non-publish
                 N   X    N   D   P    N   D   P
    old client
    pull
     N           -   X/X  -   X/D X/P  -   X/D X/P
     X           -   X/X  -   X/D X/P  -   X/D X/P
    push
     X           X/X X/X  X/P X/P X/P  X/D X/D X/P
    new client
    pull
     N           -   P/X  -   P/D P/P  -   D/D P/P
     D           -   P/X  -   P/D P/P  -   D/D P/P
     P           -   P/X  -   P/D P/P  -   P/D P/P
    push
     D           P/X P/X  P/P P/P P/P  D/D D/D P/P
     P           P/X P/X  P/P P/P P/P  P/P P/P P/P

Legend:

    A/B = final state on client / state on server

    * N = new/not present,
    * P = public,
    * D = draft,
    * X = not tracked (i.e., the old client or server has no internal
          way of recording the phase.)

    passive = only pushes


    A cell here can be read like this:

    "When a new client pushes a draft changeset (D) to a publishing
    server where it's not present (N), it's marked public on both
    sides (P/P)."

Note: old client behave as a publishing server with draft only content
- other people see it as public
- content is pushed as draft

mercurial/transaction.py

transaction.py - simple journaling scheme for mercurial

This transaction scheme is intended to gracefully handle program
errors and interruptions. More serious failures like system crashes
