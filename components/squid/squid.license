                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.

                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2.1, February 1999

 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Lesser General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990

That's all there is to it!

squid_kerb_ldap Read Me

Markus Moeller
June 2, 2007

1 Introduction

squid_kerb_ldap is a reference implementation that supports SASL/GSSAPI authentication 
to an ldap server. It is mainly intended to connect to Active Directory or Openldap based 
ldap servers.

For AD it checks the memberof attribute to determine if a user is member of a group.
For non AD it checks the memberuid attribute to determine if a user is member of a group and if not it checks if the primary group matches.
Currently, squid_kerb_ldap supports Squid 2.6 on Linux. 

squid_auth_ldap requires either MIT or Heimdal Kerberos libraries and header files.

2 Building and Installation

./configure
make

Copy the helper squid_kerb_ldap to an apropriate directory.

3 Configuration

a) Configure IE or Firefox to point to the squid proxy by using the fqdn. IE and Firefox will use the
fqdn to query for a HTTP/fqdn Kerberos service principal. 

b) Create a keytab which contains the HTTP/fqdn Kerberos service principal and place it into a directory
where the squid run user can read the keytab. 

c) Add the following line to squid.conf

auth_param negotiate program /usr/sbin/squid_kerb_auth 
auth_param negotiate children 10
auth_param negotiate keep_alive on

external_acl_type squid_kerb_ldap ttl=3600  negative_ttl=3600  %LOGIN /usr/sbin/squid_kerb_ldap -g GROUP@
acl ldap_group_check external squid_kerb_ldap
http_access allow ldap_group_check

If a ntlm helper is used too add a -N option to map the netbios name to a Kerberos realm e.g.

external_acl_type squid_kerb_ldap ttl=3600  negative_ttl=3600  %LOGIN /usr/sbin/squid_kerb_ldap -g GROUP@ -N NETBIOS@KERBEROS.REALM
acl ldap_group_check external squid_kerb_ldap
http_access allow ldap_group_check


d) Modify squid startup file

Add the following lines to the squid startup script to point squid to a keytab file which
contains the HTTP/fqdn service principal for the default Kerberos domain. The fqdn must be 
the proxy name set in IE or firefox. You can not use an IP address.

KRB5_KTNAME=/etc/squid/HTTP.keytab
export KRB5_KTNAME

If you use a different Kerberos domain than the machine itself is in you can point squid to 
the separate Kerberos config file by setting the following environment variable in the startup 
script.

KRB5_CONFIG=/etc/krb5-squid.conf
export KRB5_CONFIG

4 Miscellaneous

The -i options creates informational messages whereas -d creates full debug output 

If squid_kerb_ldap doesn't determine for some reason the right service ldap server you can provide 
it with -u BIND_DN -p BIND_PW -b BIND_PATH -l LDAP_URL

STARTTLS/SSL is supported and the -a options disables server certificate checks 

If you serve multiple Kerberos realms add a HTTP/fqdn@REALM service principal per realm to the 
HTTP.keytab file and use the -s GSS_C_NO_NAME option with squid_kerb_auth.

squid_kerb_ldap will determine automagically the right ldap server. The following method is used:

1) For user@REALM
   1) Query DNS for SRV record _ldap._tcp.REALM
   2) Query DNS for A record REALM
   3) Use LDAP_URL if given   

2) For user
   2) Use LDAP_URL if given
   
The Groups to check against are determined as follows:

1 For user@REALM
   1) Use values given by -g option which contain a @REALM e.g. -g GROUP1@REALM:GROUP2@REALM
   2) Use values given by -g option which contain a @ only e.g. -g GROUP1@:GROUP2@
   3) Use values given by -g option which do not contain a realm e.g. -g GROUP1:GROUP2

1 For user
   3) Use values given by -g option which do not contain a realm e.g. -g GROUP1:GROUP2


To support Non-ASCII character use -t <GROUP>  or -t <GROUP>@<REALM> instead of -g where GROUP is the hex UTF-8 representation e.g. 

   -t 6d61726b7573 instead of -g markus

The REALM must still be based on the ASCII character set. If REALM contains also non ASCII characters use -T <GROUP>@<REALM> where GROUP and REALM are hex UTF-8 representation e.g.

  -T 6d61726b7573@57494e3230303352322e484f4d45 instead of -g markus@WIN2003R2.HOME

For a translation of hex UTF-8 see for example http://www.utf8-chartable.de/unicode-utf8-table.pl

src/auth/basic/RADIUS/README

basic_radius_auth V1.09

This kit is loosely based on radtest from the Cistron-radiusd which
again is based on Livingston sources. See COPYRIGHT for details.

This authenticator is specifically made for Squid-2.5 and later.

Installation:

Copy the correct makefile to Makefile
   Makefile.default = Most OS:es.
   Makefile.solaris = SunOS5 (Solaris)

cp Makefile.default Makefile   
make clean
make install

or if you want the helper installed elsewhere than /usr/local/squid
(the default installation path of Squid) use something like:

make CONFDIR=/etc PREFIX=/usr BINDIR='${PREFIX}/libexec/squid' install

Complete list of make options for tweakin the installation paths:

  PREFIX   Top level installation directory (/usr/local/squid)
  BINDIR   Where the binary is installed (PREFIX/libexec)
  CONFDIR  Where the configuration file is installed (PREFIX/etc)
  MANDIR   Where the manpage is installed (PREFIX/man/man8)
  MANEXT   Manpage extension (.8)
  DESTDIR  Root prefix for packaging


Configuration:

The RADIUS authenticator is configured using a small configuration file.

The configuration file should look like this:
# basic_radius_auth configuration file
# MvS: 28-10-1998
server suncone.cistron.nl
secret testje

An example can be found in etc/basic_radius_auth.conf 


/etc/services:

Modify /etc/services and add:
radius          1812/udp

Adding this is not mandatory because it used the default port 1812 anyway.

Note: Some old RADIUS servers uses the unofficial port 1645, and you may
need to override the service port used either by editing /etc/services
or by specifying the port using the -p command line option or the port
tag in basic_radius_auth.conf


Test it:

Start basic_radius_auth and type a username and a username. The authenticator
returns OK if the radiusd accepted your password. In any other case you'll
get ERR.


Squid:

Add the authenticator to squid.conf. See the instructions from squid for
help.

squid_kerb_auth Read Me

Markus Moeller
May 12, 2007

1 Introduction

squid_kerb_auth is a reference implementation that supports authentication via 
the Negotiate RFC 4559 for proxies. It decodes RFC 2478 SPNEGO GSS-API tokens 
from IE7 either through helper functions or via SPNEGO supporting Kerberos libraries
and RFC 1964 Kerberos tokens from Firefox on Linux. Currently, squid_kerb_auth
 supports Squid 2.6 on Linux. 

squid_auth_kerb requires either MIT or Heimdal Kerberos libraries and header files.

2 Building and Installation

Run ./configure

for help use ./configure --help

Copy the helper squid_kerb_auth to an apropriate directory.

3 Configuration

a) Configure IE or Firefox to point to the squid proxy by using the fqdn. IE and Firefox will use the
fqdn to query for a HTTP/fqdn Kerberos service principal. 

b) Create a keytab which contains the HTTP/fqdn Kerberos service principal and place it into a directory
where the squid run user can read the keytab. 

c) Add the following line to squid.conf

auth_param negotiate program /usr/sbin/squid_kerb_auth 
auth_param negotiate children 10
auth_param negotiate keep_alive on

d) Modify squid startup file

Add the following lines to the squid startup script to point squid to a keytab file which
contains the HTTP/fqdn service principal for the default Kerberos domain. The fqdn must be 
the proxy name set in IE or firefox. You can not use an IP address.

KRB5_KTNAME=/etc/squid/HTTP.keytab
export KRB5_KTNAME

If you use a different Kerberos domain than the machine itself is in you can point squid to 
the separate Kerberos config file by setting the following environment variable in the startup 
script.

KRB5_CONFIG=/etc/krb-squid5.conf
export KRB5_CONFIG

4 Miscellaneous

If squid_kerb_auth doesn't determine for some reason the right service principal you can provide 
it with -s HTTP/fqdn.

If you serve multiple Kerberos realms add a HTTP/fqdn@REALM service principal per realm to the 
HTTP.keytab file and use the -s GSS_C_NO_NAME option with squid_kerb_auth.

cfgaux/ltmain.sh

This file is a library for parsing options in your shell scripts along
with assorted other useful supporting features that you can make use
of too.

For the simplest scripts you might need only:

  #!/bin/sh
  . relative/path/to/funclib.sh
  . relative/path/to/options-parser
  scriptversion=1.0
  func_options ${1+"$@"}
  eval set dummy "$func_options_result"; shift
  ...rest of your script...

In order for the '--version' option to work, you will need to have a
suitably formatted comment like the one at the top of this file
starting with '# Written by ' and ending with '# Copyright'.

For '-h' and '--help' to work, you will also need a one line
description of your script's purpose in a comment directly above the
'# Written by ' line, like the one at the top of this file.

The default options also support '--debug', which will turn on shell
execution tracing (see the comment above debug_cmd below for another
use), and '--verbose' and the func_verbose function to allow your script
to display verbose messages only when your user has specified
'--verbose'.

After sourcing this file, you can plug in processing for additional
options by amending the variables from the 'Configuration' section
below, and following the instructions in the 'Option parsing'
section further down.

func_version
------------
Echo version message to standard output and exit.
The version message is extracted from the calling file's header
comments, with leading '# ' stripped:
  1. First display the progname and version
  2. Followed by the header comment line matching  /^# Written by /
  3. Then a blank line followed by the first following line matching
     /^# Copyright /
  4. Immediately followed by any lines between the previous matches,
     except lines preceding the intervening completely blank line.
For example, see the header comments of this file.

compat/strnstr.cc

 Shamelessly duplicated from the FreeBSD public sources
 for use by the Squid Project under GNU Public License.

Update/Maintenance History:

   26-Apr-2008 : Copied from FreeBSD via OpenGrok
         - added protection around library headers
         - added squid_ prefix for uniqueness
           so we can use it where OS copy is broken.

## Files:
compat/xstrto.cc

 Shamelessly duplicated from the netfilter iptables sources
 for use by the Squid Project under GNU Public License.

Reason for use as explained by Luciano Coelho:
"I found that there is a bug in strtoul (and strtoull for
that matter) that causes the long to overflow if there are valid digits
after the maximum possible digits for the base.  For example if you try
to strtoul 0xfffffffff (with 9 f's) the strtoul will overflow and come
up with a bogus result.  I can't easily truncate the string to avoid
this problem, because with decimal or octal, the same valid value would
take more spaces.  I could do some magic here, checking whether it's a
hex, dec or oct and truncate appropriately, but that would be very ugly.
So the simplest way I came up with was to use strtoull and return
-EINVAL if the value exceeds 32 bits."

Update/Maintenance History:

   12-Sep-2010 : Copied from iptables xtables.c
         - xtables_strtoui renamed to xstrtoui
         - xtables_strtoul renamed to xstrtoul

include/heap.h

Copyright (C) 1999 by Hewlett Packard

Heap data structure.  Used to store objects for cache replacement.  The
heap is implemented as a contiguous array in memory.  Heap sort and heap
update are done in-place.  The heap is ordered with the smallest value at
the top of the heap (as in the smallest object key value).  Child nodes
are larger than their parent.


## Files:
include/md5.h

This is the header file for the MD5 message-digest algorithm.
The algorithm is due to Ron Rivest.  This code was
written by Colin Plumb in 1993, no copyright is claimed.
This code is in the public domain; do with it what you wish.

Equivalent code is available from RSA Data Security, Inc.
This code has been tested against that, and is equivalent,
except that you don't need to include two pages of legalese
with every copy.

To compute the message digest of a chunk of bytes, declare an
MD5Context structure, pass it to MD5Init, call MD5Update as
needed on buffers full of bytes, and then call MD5Final, which
will fill a supplied 16-byte array with the digest.

Changed so as no longer to depend on Colin Plumb's `usual.h'
header definitions; now uses stuff from dpkg's config.h
 - Ian Jackson <ian@chiark.greenend.org.uk>.
Still in the public domain.

Changed MD5Update to take a void * for easier use and some other
minor cleanup. - Henrik Nordstrom <henrik@henriknordstrom.net>.
Still in the public domain.

Prefixed all symbols with "Squid" so they don't collide with
other libraries.  Duane Wessels <wessels@squid-cache.org>.
Still in the public domain.

lib/md5.c

This code implements the MD5 message-digest algorithm.
The algorithm is due to Ron Rivest.  This code was
written by Colin Plumb in 1993, no copyright is claimed.
This code is in the public domain; do with it what you wish.

Equivalent code is available from RSA Data Security, Inc.
This code has been tested against that, and is equivalent,
except that you don't need to include two pages of legalese
with every copy.

To compute the message digest of a chunk of bytes, declare an
SquidMD5Context structure, pass it to SquidMD5Init, call
SquidMD5Update as needed on buffers full of bytes, and then call
SquidMD5Final, which will fill a supplied 16-byte array with the
digest.

Changed so as no longer to depend on Colin Plumb's `usual.h' header
definitions; now uses stuff from dpkg's config.h.
 - Ian Jackson <ian@chiark.greenend.org.uk>.
Still in the public domain.

Changed SquidMD5Update to take a void * for easier use and some
other minor cleanup. - Henrik Nordstrom <henrik@henriknordstrom.net>.
Still in the public domain.

Prefixed all symbols with "Squid" so they don't collide with
other libraries.  Duane Wessels <wessels@squid-cache.org>.
Still in the public domain.

The source in this file is derived from the reference implementation
in RFC 2617.
RFC 2617 is Copyright (C) The Internet Society (1999).  All Rights Reserved.

The Squid copyright and licence statement covers all changes made to the
reference implementation.

Key changes were: alteration to a plain C layout.
Create CvtBin function
Allow CalcHA1 to make use of precaculated username:password:realm hash's
to prevent squid knowing the users password (idea suggested in RFC 2617).

with contributions from others mentioned in the Changes section below

Usage: squid_ldap_auth -b basedn [-s searchscope]
                       [-f searchfilter] [-D binddn -w bindpasswd]
                       [-u attr] [-h host] [-p port] [-P] [-R] [ldap_server_name[:port]] ...

Dependencies: You need to get the OpenLDAP libraries
from http://www.openldap.org or another compatible LDAP C-API
implementation.

If you want to make a TLS enabled connection you will also need the
OpenSSL libraries linked into openldap. See http://www.openssl.org/

Changes:
2019-01-02: Amish
            - Use SEND_*() macro and support for BH error
2005-01-07: Henrik Nordstrom <hno@squid-cache.org>
            - Added some sanity checks on login names to avoid
              users bypassing equality checks by exploring the
              overly helpful match capabilities of LDAP
2004-07-17: Henrik Nordstrom <hno@squid-cache.org>
            - Corrected non-persistent mode to only issue one
              ldap_bind per connection.
            - -U option to compare the users password rather
              than binding.
2004-03-01: Henrik Nordstrom <hno@squid-cache.org>
            - corrected building of search filters to escape
              unsafe input
            - -d option for "debug" like squid_ldap_group
2004-01-05: Henrik Nordstrom <hno@squid-cache.org>
            - Corrected TLS mode
2003-03-01: David J N Begley
            - Support for Netscape API method of ldap over SSL
              connections
            - Timeout option for better recovery when using
              multiple LDAP servers
2003-03-01: Christoph Lechleitner <lech@ibcl.at>
            - Added -W option to read bindpasswd from file
2003-03-01: Juerg Michel
            - Added support for ldap URI via the -H option
              (requires OpenLDAP)
2001-12-12: Michael Cunningham <m.cunningham@xpedite.com>
            - Added TLS support and partial ldap version 3 support.
2001-10-04: Henrik Nordstrom <hno@squid-cache.org>
            - Be consistent with the other helpers in how
              spaces are managed. If there is space characters
              then these are assumed to be part of the password
2001-09-05: Henrik Nordstrom <hno@squid-cache.org>
            - Added ability to specify another default LDAP port to
              connect to. Persistent connections moved to -P
2001-05-02: Henrik Nordstrom <hno@squid-cache.org>
            - Support newer OpenLDAP 2.x libraries using the
              revised Internet Draft API which unfortunately
              is not backwards compatible with RFC1823..
2001-04-15: Henrik Nordstrom <hno@squid-cache.org>
            - Added command line option for basedn
            - Added the ability to search for the user DN
2001-04-16: Henrik Nordstrom <hno@squid-cache.org>
            - Added -D binddn -w bindpasswd.
2001-04-17: Henrik Nordstrom <hno@squid-cache.org>
            - Added -R to disable referrals
            - Added -a to control alias dereferencing
2001-04-17: Henrik Nordstrom <hno@squid-cache.org>
            - Added -u, DN username attribute name

Install instructions:

This program authenticates users against a PAM configured authentication
service "squid". This allows you to authenticate Squid users to any
authentication source for which you have a PAM module. Commonly available
PAM modules includes "UNIX", RADIUS, Kerberos and SMB, but a lot of other
PAM modules are available from various sources.

Example PAM configuration for standard UNIX passwd authentication:
/etc/pam.conf:
 squid auth     required /lib/security/pam_unix.so.1
 squid account  required /lib/security/pam_unix.so.1

Note that some PAM modules (for example shadow password authentication)
requires the program to be installed suid root to gain access to the
user password database

Change Log:

  Version 2.3, 2009-11-06
     Converted to C++. Brought into line with Squid-3 code styles.

  Version 2.2, 2003-11-05
     One shot mode is now the default mode of operation
     with persistent PAM connections enabled by -t option.
     Support for clearing the PAM_AUTHTOK attribute on
     persistent PAM connections.

  Version 2.1, 2002-08-12
     Squid-2.5 support (URL encoded login, password strings)

  Version 2.0, 2002-01-07
     One shot mode, command line options
 man page

  Version 1.3, 1999-12-10
     Bugfix release 1.3 to work around Solaris 2.6
     brokenness (not sending arguments to conversation
     functions)

  Version 1.2, internal release

  Version 1.1, 1999-05-11

AUTHOR: Robert Collins.
Based on ncsa_auth.c by Arjan de Vet <Arjan.deVet@adv.iae.nl>
LDAP backend extension by Flavio Pescuma, MARA Systems AB <flavio@marasystems.com>

Example digest authentication program for Squid, based on the original
proxy_auth code from client_side.c, written by
Jon Thackray <jrmt@uk.gdscorp.com>.

- comment lines are possible and should start with a '#';
- empty or blank lines are possible;
- file format is username:password

To build a directory integrated backend, you need to be able to
calculate the HA1 returned to squid. To avoid storing a plaintext
password you can calculate MD5(username:realm:password) when the
user changes their password, and store the tuple username:realm:HA1.
then find the matching username:realm when squid asks for the
HA1.

This implementation could be improved by using such a triple for
the file format.  However storing such a triple does little to
improve security: If compromised the username:realm:HA1 combination
is "plaintext equivalent" - for the purposes of digest authentication
they allow the user access. Password synchronization is not tackled
by digest - just preventing on the wire compromise.

- comment lines are possible and should start with a '#';
- empty or blank lines are possible;
- file format is username:password

To build a directory integrated backend, you need to be able to
calculate the HA1 returned to squid. To avoid storing a plaintext
password you can calculate MD5(username:realm:password) when the
user changes their password, and store the tuple username:realm:HA1.
then find the matching username:realm when squid asks for the
HA1.

This implementation could be improved by using such a triple for
the file format.  However storing such a triple does little to
improve security: If compromised the username:realm:HA1 combination
is "plaintext equivalent" - for the purposes of digest authentication
they allow the user access. Password synchronization is not tackled
by digest - just preventing on the wire compromise.
