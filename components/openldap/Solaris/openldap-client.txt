OpenLDAP 2.6 CLI and developer changes

Please note that
- Common options '-h' and '-p' on ldap commands have been deprecated
  since OpenLDAP 2.4 and were officially removed in 2.6.  Currently a
  reprieve has been put in place to accept both options and display a
  warning if used with remedial advice to use '-H URI'.  The warning
  can be disabled if environment variable LDAP_OPT_REPRIEVE is set.
  Beware though that a future update will remove those options or
  worse repurpose them!  Stop using them now, and modify your scripts.

- Directory /usr/include/openldap is deprecated, headers are now in
  standard location; /usr/include.  Modify projects as necessary, a
  compatibility link has been provided which will be removed in the
  future.
